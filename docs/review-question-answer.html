      <div class="reviewText"><mark>I originally purchased this for my den, but, then I decided I wanted something more which includes a surge protector.</mark>  This is great for my work bench and the outlets are spaced nicely, however, because the outlets are verticle, you still have issues when using bricks...they still interfere with the next outlet.</div>
      <div class="question">Is this a surge protector?</div>
      <div class="answer">No. It only provides multiple outlets from one wall outlet. I used it to connect multiple devices to power at a work station. I used a battery backup system to provide surge isolation.</div>

        <p>With its high-end component-video DVD outputs, VHS recording and playback abilities, built-in MP3 de<span id="dots-B0001H4AYE-ALJONSEWYT1J8">...</span><span id="more-B0001H4AYE-ALJONSEWYT1J8" style="display:none">coding, and compatibility with JPEG image CDs and Kodak Picture CDs, Samsung's DVD-V4600 DVD/VCR combo is a conveniently slim entertainment dynamo. Now you'll be able to enjoy a slideshow of your digital pictures right on your television. It will play video-mode DVD-R/RW and DVD+R/RW discs, too, making it a great gift for family members with whom you'd like to share your home videos on DVD. This model also includes front-panel audio/video inputs so you can quickly and easily hook up a camcorder or gaming console.Whether your living room is currently home to an HDTV or you're merely thinking of "someday," the DVD-V4600 stands ready to deliver the full potential of your DVDs. Progressive scanning, referred to as 480p for the number of horizontal lines that compose the video image, creates a picture using twice the scan lines of a conventional DVD picture, giving you higher resolution and sharper images while eliminating nearly all motion artifacts.The VCR delivers hi-fi stereo sound and quasi-S-VHS (SQPB) playback, which lets you view S-VHS cassettes--normally only playable on high-end S-VHS machines--in standard VHS resolution. The unit's 4-head design ensures smooth slow-motion play (forward and reverse) and clear still-frame images. Use the VCR's advance-record settings to make sure you never miss a favorite show or pertinent one-time broadcast.Top-of-the-line component-video outputs (for DVD only) help minimize digital and line-scan artifacts on compatible advanced televisions, while composite- and S-video outputs bring DVD compatibility with nearly any television. The VCR output is composite-video and RF only. A set of left/right analog-audio outputs for both DVD and VCR components channel audio to Dolby Pro Logic receivers and stereo televisions. Both Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1-channel surround-sound DVD signals can be routed through the player's digital-audio outputs (one each optical and coaxial) for direct connection to a full-featuredaudio/video receiver.Another handy feature is EZ View letterbox eliminator, which lets you enjoy full-screen pictures on 4:3 aspect-ratio TVs--even when you're watching widescreen DVDs.What's in the BoxDVD/VCR combo unit, IR remote control, 2 AA batteries, user's manual, stereo analog audio interconnect/composite-video cable, and warranty information.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B0001H4AYE-ALJONSEWYT1J8')" id="toggleBtn-B0001H4AYE-ALJONSEWYT1J8">Show more</button>

      <div class="reviewText">I have had this combo unit for about 6 months. It worked fine for a while then whamo. The DVD player heats up about half way through a movie and the picture freezes and will not play. The door on the DVD side has fallen off (not due to any rough treatment). The VCR makes funny noises when playing a tape. <mark>The remote control is not a universal remote so I had to add one more remote to my collection.</mark> I'am very unhappy with this unit.</div>
      <div class="question">does it has remote control</div>
      <div class="answer">Yes. You can see in the description details, all the way at the bottom, section says \"what's in the box\". I didn't think this was a good product at all. I think only half of it worked after 6 months. I tossed it after less than a year!</div>

      <div class="reviewText">These headphones are FANTASTIC.Normally, I'm too lazy to write reviews but these were just too good for me to NOT write a review. They do take a good amount of time to break in. I didn't listen to them that much in the beginning, partially because they weren't as good as I was expecting and partially because I just didn't want to run them for that long. <mark>But after about two to three months, I could all of sudden notice how much better they sound.Now if you're one of those people who don't really appreciate quality sound and just want booming bass, these aren't the headphones for you.</mark> I'm not saying these headphones don't have bass, but it's not like the Dr. Dre's Beats that pretty much overload on bass and can't produce quality music worth crap. These headphones have excellent balance. They are great in the midtones and highs. The bass is not boomy like on many pseudo "quality headphones" (Beats) but very punchy and clear. Overall, for a price of 65$,  you will be glad you bought these. They will last you years and years.The only slight problem, as many of the other reviews say, are that the cups are a little smaller than the other closed design headphones, such as the Bose QuietComfort. These headphones, unless you have very small ears, will probably not fit all the way around your ears. I don't agree that they are very tight though. I feel they are perfectly fine in tightness, just that the cups are a little small. But like many of the other reviews, you can't argue with the sound quality. Get the Beyerdynamic velour replacement pads and they will make the bass better, make the noise isolation better, and the comfort better (less heat).</div>
      <div class="question">Do these headphones have a true, flat sound or do they boost bass/highs/mids/anything? I need headphones for monitoring that reproduce true.</div>
      <div class="answer">They're flat. http://www.headphone.com/headphones/sony-mdr-v6.php Look at the response curve. They work great for mixing/monitoring.</div>

If the charging rate could just be adjusted to a 2nd optional & smaller current it would be nice, as that would assure even more longevity for the cells when not in a hurry for fresh ones. The unit gets slightly warm as it's working though this is normal as is the very light "squealing hiss" one hears only if lowering their ears to the unit as it's charging.

      <div class="reviewText">The KMW33117 is a compact, light weight, a bit overpriced but it will allow you to "plug in" your US device into just about any outlet in the world. However, this device WILL NOT CONVERT YOUR VOLTAGE. I actually did not realize this until I took the product out of its packaging in Beijing China where I discovered a red sticker wrapped around the device stating that "THIS DEVICE WILL NOT CONVERT VOLTAGE". OK, wasn't that the point of purchasing this product in the first place ? Great, I can plug it in but I also may fry all of my electronic equipment in the process. <mark>However, what KM failed to inform to its consumer public is that most laptops and cell phone chargers already have a voltage converter built into their chargers (and AC power strips in the case of the laptops) and in these cases, all that is required is a "plug adapter" like the one from KM.</mark> However, however, some electronics, like my wife's hair-dryer require a VOLTAGE CONVERTOR in addition to a plug adapter like KM's. I suggest you bring along both just in case. You can find Voltage Converters at Radio-Shack but they are bulky, heavy and expensive. You're phone and laptop chargers will tell you is if they have built in "voltage converters". Look to see if they have written on them "...110v to 240 and 50Hz to 60Hz", if so then you are OK to go with just the "plug adapter"Safe travels.</div>
      <div class="question">Do I just plug my phone into it, and then plug the adapter into the wall?</div>
      <div class="answer">It takes a normal plug. Not a phone USB. So no.</div>

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">07 7, 2011</div>
      <div class="reviewText">I have had mine almost 1 year. I really like reading on it. I love the instant gratification of getting the books when I want them. However...1. I have run across several books NOT available through Nook which is irritating.2. Some books REQUIRE WiFi: I bought the 3G version b/c I do not usually have access to WiFi. <mark>But some books require WiFi to download.</mark> This is not noted anywhere until after you buy the book and try to download it via 3G.3. Sample Books for Free: When I have tried this all I ever download is the book description, which I can read anyway.4. Lend Me: Only SOME books (decided by B&N;) are available to be lent (most of mine are not) and once you lend a book to someone, they have access to it for 2 weeks and then you can NEVER loan it to them or anyone else ever again. B&N; is not very upfront about this.5. The web browser is a joke...don't plan on doing much with it.6. The dictionary is incomplete and clunky.7. Sometimes I have trouble downloading books via 3G. B&N; customer service attributes this to spotty 3G coverage in my area which I question since I live outside a major metropolitan area and have no problems with my iPhone ever.</div>
      <div class="question">what does it mean by wifi? does that mean i can only read books when i have wifi or does that mean i can only download books when i have wifi?</div>
      <div class="answer">Like others have said, you buy and download books with the wifi. But, you can read it off of it. By the way, there are newer versions of this ereader that are just as economical. Good luck with whatever you do.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">Let's get realistic. Most any battery is good for about 1500 charge cycles. <mark>If you have enough capacity to charge just once per day, that would last you 4 years.</mark> Unfortunately, even with battery monitors, etc, I find my S3 generally needs to be charged twice per day. So getting two years out of a battery is getting bad. I feel like these batteries have at least the capacity of the original Samsung battery, but it did not last as long as the first one. It's capacity dropped too much in 6-9 months, for me. That said, I did decide to buy another one, as I still think it's a better buy than other solutions available, and the price of the Samsung battery is just ridiculous. However, I did end up paying MORE for the second one that the first, which did not make me happy.</div>
      <div class="question">What is the best way to charge these batteries to ensure longest life and most effective use?</div>
      <div class="answer">I charged it as normal. I pretty much use it until it reaches around 20% battery life. I also keep my phone plugged in most of the time when under heavy use.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">This is what happaned when I tried to use this drive on an otherwise stable Windows 2000 system:The Iomega Tools installer demanded an immediate restart as soon as it completed.The system hung on restart and had to be power-cycled.A new item called 'active disk' appeared in the system tray on successful restart.  There was nothing indicating it had anything to do with Iomega at all.The Iomega entry on the Programs menu had nothing in it but a couple of web links ('help' and 'update').I was able to read a pre-recorded Zip disk with no problems, however, when I tried to eject the disk (using the right-click menu item),  Windows flung a bunch of panicked popups, yelling at me for disconnecting hardware without going through the "safely disconnect hardware" interface -- it basically acted as though I'd unceremoniously yanked out the USB cable while the drive was still spinning.  <mark>Then it vomited up one of those always-delightful "Unrecognized exception" error popups, and promptly hung.When I used this drive with an OSX system, every time I tried to eject a disk, the drive spun for over a minute before spitting out the disk.This is all mysterious.</mark>  I never had these kinds of problems with the SCSI Zip drives.In any case, at $10 a pop, the Zip media format has been effectively eclipsed by writable CDs and DVDs.</div>

      <div class="reviewText"><mark>We got this screen for pocket projector use, I set it up in our living room to test it out over month ago, and we ended up using it every day.</mark> No complaints whatsoever, very sturdy. The screen rolls up nicely in its all metal tube. Understand that when they say 40'' x 40'' the measurement is taken from the very edge of the screen, so the white screen portion is actually 37 1/2''. I would have preferred the next larger screen because of this. Also, you can extend the screen partially to alter it's aspect ratio, which was something I was curious about before purchase, but was not mentioned by other reviewers. Bottom line, if you're looking for a small presentation screen with a small price, you can't go wrong with da-lite.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">I returned this product.  We have older wiring in our home, and there are surges all summer long due to the A/C.  We try to replace all surge protectors once a year to try to protect our electrial items. This product had excellent reviews, so I purchased it.  Did not work! <mark>There was only one place where I was able to plug in a 3 prong connection.I don't have a lot of strength in my hands right now, but I was still able to plug in devices in other new surge protectors.</mark>  Looking at the strip, there is some type of metal running through the 3rd prong area that prevents any cord from going in.  Very disappointed!</div>

While this Sony product works best with Sony CD and MD players, the adaptor will operate with non-Sony products as well. There are a couple of key features to this adaptor which make it a fine choice. The first notable feature is the spring-loaded head. The head will automatically adjust itself to your vehicle's cassette deck, ensuring that the two heads have optimum contact and transfer the best possible sound. The second key feature is the silent mechanism. A silent mechanism yields less operational noise and a better quality MD or CD sound. This adaptor works with all cassette players which require you to insert the tape opening facing the side. The mini-plug inserts into a portable CD or MD headphone jack. The cassette adaptor is a cheap way to make your vehicle CD and MD operational.What's in the BoxSony CPA-9C Cassette Adaptor</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B00005T39Y-A1AC6UOKLNWY1E')" id="toggleBtn-B00005T39Y-A1AC6UOKLNWY1E">Show more</button>

        <p>Feast your eyes on 1,920 x 1,200 pixels in the 23-inch Apple Cinema Display. The Apple Cinema Displa<span id="dots-B0002ILKNQ-A2WM1KL9DQSQ18">...</span><span id="more-B0002ILKNQ-A2WM1KL9DQSQ18" style="display:none">y line features a gorgeous new anodized aluminum enclosure to complement the Power Mac G5 or PowerBook G4.Eliminate Tunnel VisionThe widescreen design of the Apple Cinema Display line offers a natural format   for arranging documents the way your brain processes them&#x97;longer wide than high.   That's why each display gives you the best view for your work. It just makes   sense to be able to display a Web page and its code next to each other horizontally,   or long video timelines in wide format. Apple engineers find that the nearly   100-pixel per inch resolution is ideal for images, yet allows you to easily   work with sophisticated type treatments or just plain email. This painstaking   attention to detail moves the industry forward and gives you best LCD technology   available.Enjoy One or         Two Artful DisplaysThe Apple Cinema display matches the sculpted aluminum enclosures of the         Power Mac G5 and PowerBook. This strong, anodized aluminum also allows         for an exceptionally narrow bezel, so you can use multiple displays together         seamlessly. The Cinema Display hovers above your desk on a curvaceous         stand, and hardly requires any pressure to adjust the viewing angle from         -5 to 25 degrees, since the enclosure is the lightest Apple display ever,         at each size. And some ineffable quality of pure elemental aluminum just         feels better to the touch.Connect with Pure Digital DVIGive your PowerBook G4 a second display when you're not on the road. Connect         directly to any PowerBook G4 with a DVI port. The DVI connection removes         all barriers to using an Apple display with a PC, if your graphics card         supports DVI with DDC technology for widescreen viewing.Strong anodized aluminum also allows for an       exceptionally narrow bezel, so you can use multiple displays together seamlessly.Adjust your Apple display from -5&deg; to 25&deg;         with little effort.&nbsp;Effortless AdjustmentThe smooth motion hinge on your Apple display requires very little pressure         to tilt the monitor to a different position. This design allows you to         you view the display at whatever angle works for your environment, anywhere         from -5&deg; to 25&deg;.Pure SignalWhen you need to manipulate color in any media, image distortion is simply         not an option. Analog conversion problems caused by a VGA connection become         progressively worse as you move to monitors that have higher resolutions         or longer monitor cables. These issues fade away with an all digital signal.         DVI transmits a distortion-free digital signal from a digital location         in the graphics card to a digital location on the display&#8217;s screen.         This digital connection gives you the full clarity and stability of liquid         crystal technology &#8212; with sharp, clear pixels from edge to edge.Responsive FeedbackPixel response time provides a good measure of a display&#8217;s performance         in media critical applications, such as video, 3D and motion graphics,         or even when you&#8217;re taking a break with a game. An Apple display         provides fast pixel response time across the entire spectrum from black         and white, to every shade of gray.Peripheral Devices on         Your DesktopThis display includes a FireWire 400 hub and a USB 2.0 hub, each with         two ports. So you can connect a printer or scanner, or a digital camera         or camcorder. The FireWire port provides a convenient place to plug in         an iSight camera for video chat, presented beautifully on your Apple display,         or to connect your iPod dock. You can also make best use of all the latest         USB 2.0 devices, whether you're using your display with a Mac or PC.This display includes two-port, self-powered USB         2.0 hub, two FireWire 400 ports and a Kensington security port</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B0002ILKNQ-A2WM1KL9DQSQ18')" id="toggleBtn-B0002ILKNQ-A2WM1KL9DQSQ18">Show more</button>

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">09 27, 2005</div>
      <div class="reviewText">As other reviewers have pointed out, Apple seems to have solved the "pink issue". I have been using this display for over a month now, with no issues. No dead pixels either.I bought this display for use with my Mac mini. I started with a Mac hooked to my PC monitor/keyboard/mouse. <mark>I've always been a fan of using dual monitors on my PC's, but had no way to do this with a Mac mini.</mark> So I decided to get the largest single monitor that I could.The 23" cinema works just as well as dual monitor for me. The extra wide display allows me to place applications side-by-side and not have to be flipping through windows. The display is very clear. It does produce more heat than I expected, but it is by no means "hot to the touch".The extra USB and Firewire ports are nice. But I wish Apple could have put more than 2 USB ports on it. They certainly had the space.</div>
      <div class="question">Compatible with latest Mac Mini? and.....might the used version be worth the chance?</div>
      <div class="answer">I would imagine that any of the latest Apple computers, which have more powerful chips, would be able to run the 23 inch monitor. As long as the ports and cables are compatible I don't see why they would be in issue. That being said, I do see why there would be an issue. That being said, I can't say with absolute certainty whether they are compatible. I realize my answer is a bit ambiguous, but I hope it helps.</div>

Unfortunately, the DCR-TRV140 can't play Hi8 and 8mm footage, as its bigger brothers up the line, like the DCR-TRV240, can. However, it is Sony's least-expensive digital camcorder, and is quite a steal for those who want to make the digital plunge.To start off, Sony put in a 20x optical zoom and paired it with SteadyShot image stabilization. Image stabilization is a handy technology that helps to eliminate the shakiness associated with high zoom levels. The only way to avoid shakiness completely is to utilize a tripod, table, or other stable surface. The 2.5-inch LCD is the best way to frame your shots, although you can use the black-and-white EVF to preserve battery life.In addition to the normal slew of ports (IEEE 1394, S-video, mini-AV) that have made their way onto the TRV140, there's also a USB port, which, with some included software, offers some interesting functions. Specifically, it allows you to use the camcorder to capture stills, or "broadcast live video with audio," according to Sony, which seems to indicate you can use the TRV140 as a Webcam.The DCR-TRV140 comes with a power adapter, InfoLithium battery, remote control, two AA batteries, A/V cable, lens cap, shoulder strap, USB cable, and software CD-ROM.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B0000634T4-A12DLJESJKM1OQ')" id="toggleBtn-B0000634T4-A12DLJESJKM1OQ">Show more</button>

      <div class="reviewText">Pros: Performance for the price, features, looksCons: Size, pricey, still picture quality, no analog inputs or backward compatibility with 8mm/Hi8Summary: The Digital 8 camcorders uses Hi-8 tapes (you can use cheaper 8mm tapes but it is not recommended) and perform digital recording. The Digital 8&trade; camcorders are usually backward compatible with 8mm or Hi-8 tapes - they can play your old 8mm or Hi-8 recordings.Advantages of D8 camcorders:1. Ability to play 8mm and Hi8 recordings - TRV140 cannot do this2. Hi8 tapes are a little cheaper than MiniDV3. Sony D8 camcorders are cheaper than their MiniDV camcorders with similar features4. Even inexpensive D8 camcorders usually have analog inputs and analog-digital pass-through - TRV140 doesn'tDisadvantages:1. D8 is not widespread and if your D8 camcorder dies or becomes obsolete, you will have to get another D8 camcorder.2. Hi8 tapes are larger in size than MiniDV3. MiniDV is widely supported, unlike D8. <mark>If you need to play your tape on another digital camcorder or VCR, chances are they will be MiniDV.As you can see, two major reasons to get a Digital8 camcorder would not apply to TRV140 (you can buy TRV240, which has both 8mm/Hi8 playback and analog inputs).</mark> And the Hi8 tapes are not much cheaper than MiniDV. So the only reason would be:You want a digital camcorder from Sony that is inexpensive.The TRV140's main advantage is its price. But there is little sense in buying the Digital8 camcorder that lacks D8 features ...</div>

        <span class="summary">Best lightweight open-air headphones for your money</span>
      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">12 3, 2004</div>
      <div class="reviewText">Hi all, I have been a user of the Radio Shack Pro 25/35 series of headphones for years. The Pro 25s have been replaced by the Pro 35s, which have been replaced by the Pro 35As in the past couple years or so. You may ask "what relevance is that to me?"because the Pro 35As are rebranded versions of the KOSS KTXPRO1s(Just as the Pro25s were rebranded versions of the KTXPRO)!! They are equivalent right down to the last response spec, they even look almost identical (go look yourself!). The only real difference worth noting is the 1/8" plug on the Radio Shack verion is gold plated. Radio Shack will charge you twice the price if they are not on sale, so you can save serious dough here.Now, down to the sound and comfort which is what (i hope) all of you want to know. Of most importance to me is sound. I tell you these deliver overall sound equivalent or better than budget Sennheisers! (i have listened to the HD-220 and HD-457, the HD-457 i use for backup and extended listening). The KOSS KTXPRO1s are far superior to every lightweight headphone i have ever listened to, better than budget headphones (under $50) of just about any kind! The only sub $50 headphones that sounded even close are the Sennheiser HD-457s and i believe the Sony Street Style MDR-G73LPs of all things. Sound is rich, clear, and true, clean highs which are not harsh at all (unless your source sucks) and bass is amazingly powerful for such lightweight things. The bass is not muddy like the HD-220s nor is it unable to handle the very low bass found in music like Dance, House, Drum & Bass, Rap and Hip Hop. It is not overly punchy either, the bass in my opinion is very balanced. Midrange is true, balanced, and clear as well. Beware of the inline volume control, only use it in moderation, you may realise your CD player is turned up, and sound is not loud but there is distortion (your in-line volume is low) It is great though of people who dont like to touch the CD player for volume often or need a quick abbreviated adjustment.Comfort with these is better than 95% of all lightweights. The drivers usually make full conact with your ear ( if you have a particularly large head it may not, i wear a fitted size 7 5/8 (XL) hat and it barely makes complete contact), but over very long periods of time (over 3 hours) may make your ears hurt a bit (this was a larger problem with the Pro 25s/KTXPro but with the redesign, spring pressure of the drivers to the ears has been reduced). The rubber headband is a welcome feature, as the top of your head stays comfortable, don't worry, the rubber wont grip your hair at all. They also manage to stay on your head well enough, well, maybe not if you are running, you'll have to readjust them every now and then. <mark>For staying on your head, the Pro25/KTXPro does a better job,and will make full even contact with your ear, but they are poorer for extended listening.My one issue is that you may notice a vibrating/buzzing of the foil diaphram if you listen to high volumes with heavy backup guitar and bass a lot.</mark> I have noticed this thoroughout this line of headphones. I think that the foil diaphram becomes detached slightly over time and heavy use. As i test them now they are reproducing only very very slight vibration/buzz in the right ear (Test song: VAST - Here) and i've had these for about 7-8 months, you wouldnt hear it unless you were listening for it. But then again you get a litetime warranty so all is well.These nitpicky things cannot overshadow the outstanding sound in a lightweight headphone for the price. Even if you have to possibly buy a new pair (or have Koss give you new ones) every 6 months due to diaphram vibration/buzz (if you have good ears :) ) they are so cheap and sound so excellent for their size it's well worth the purchase.</div>
      <div class="question">How do these sound? Is it rich with some bass or tinny and not worth having?</div>
      <div class="answer">For the price, it's the best sound I've heard. Good clean bass, good midrange and highs. I bought three sets.</div>

      <div class="reviewTime">09 7, 2012</div>
      <div class="reviewText">There seems to be some confusion as to the purpose of this device. It is NOT designed for use with headphones. Headphones use two channels (left and right) so they need a stereo TRS (Tip Ring Sleeve) cable and NOT a mono TS (Tip Sleeve) cable. <mark>This splitter is a TS device so it will combine the left and right together if it is used with a stereo signal.</mark> It is, however, useful for single channel devices like guitars, microphones, or recording equipment that runs the right and left channels in separate cables. So just to summarize: Instruments good, headphones bad.</div>
      <div class="question">Can I use this to sum two stereo outputs into mono into my audio interface?</div>
      <div class="answer">Short answer, yes. But you won't be able to split the channels (L/R) on your interface. As you are going into a mono input this shouldn't be an issue.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">I am not the most correct person when it comes to technology and I, like everyone else, tend to like what I purchase, so when I purchased this rather expensive device, I expected a punching bass rather than mediocre sound and not the highest volume. After reading all the reviews on amazon.com, I decided I could not find better speakers, this would have been my first instance of usage. What I didn't notice while reading the reviews were the dates on them, most of these reviews are more than 2 years old, had I known I'm buying something that has been in the market for this long, I would have re-considered but then so many people cannot be wrong so I decided to get this particular systtem.I recently moved into a modest location somewhere in the newest of Yorks. I am setting things up and have ordered more than two dozen things from Amazon.com - this somehow being the most expensive. I keep these on the carpet and would love to turn them into the walls but I fear my neighbours won't like the new guy next door.Features -a) well packed, prompt deliveryb) comes with an unfamiliar looking bass guy and extra terrestrial looking speakersc) Wires and a manual people like me never bother withd) I assume the speakers with the volume buttons is the "RIGHT" channel - the buttons are the kinds you just hold for a second or two and only then realize whether it's actually working or notTHE GOODa) If you've used ordinary or wose speakers in the past, you will surely notice something in the vocals you didn't before, for example, the sampling in the song "DRIVE" by Incubus will appear more clear and distinct. I noticed this immediately upon purchase.b) The wires are long, the two speakers have a great stand and you can keep them on any surface because the padding or material on the bass is circular and just fits very nicely, impressive build quality on the four smaller speakers located on them satellitesc) You can disconnect both speakers from the system. My previous system was an altec lansing 2.1 which cost me 1/4the price and there was no way to disconnect the spears individually upon transfer. The wires are long and as long as you'll want them to be.The Bada) There is no power button, the blue light that comes out of the the main speakers looks ridiculous in a dark room.b) Portability - I will think three times before taking these speakers from the living room into the bed room because they look like such a mess with all the wires and they're so difficult to shift from one room to another, I realize 71% of you won't be shifting them but in my situation this is quite an issue. There is little or no way of setting these up and making the wires stay sane. The looks become so boring so quick.c) If I'm listening to Led Zeppelin's Kashmir, I just know that there appears to be an irritating lack of bass, thump and the treble is just such a downer. Imagine listening to something in volume but not quite getting enough bass and vocals on it. This system is really a no-no for someone who listens to Classic Rock/Hard Rock/Grunge etc. <mark>However, if you have this system and intend to get it, do note that if you put the system in a smaller room the sound effects are a bit mangified in comparison to a slightly more open space.d) The volume button is so annoying and I never know when it's going to work, push it a little and the speakers will start to blaste) There is a 2 second delay when you're fixing this to your computer or ipod or phone or whatever the source might be.</mark> It takes two seconds to start. A very annoying thing is how much noise the speakers make if you have not connected them to a source.The uglyI have to live with these speakers so I hope I find something to like about them. The system doesn't look good, sounds ordinary, does not have a power button to swith off, has an annoying blue light and so difficult to transfer. It is not even a lot of fun to watch films with this particular speaker. I understand I can reconfigure the EQ and make the voice come out in a better way but really the trouble I've had with this system is immense.I now think I should have paid even more and gone for something that actually fits the bill. I can't call this a rip off because my dear Amazon friends seem to love it. I guess this is just not the right speaker if you wish to be the only living boy in new york listening to Pearl Jam. Don't even try to play Dream Theater on this thing. Regret persists.**UPDATED** 08/18/2009I love these speakers and cannot live without them. 5 stars. Word.</div>

      <div class="question">How does it fit sockets of other countries? How can this be a world wide charger if it can't be plugged into the socket?</div>
      <div class="answer">Its not the prongs that make it a \"world wide charger\", its that the charger itself adapts to the different currents of electricity. Different countries sometimes use different \"types\" of electricity, whether it be ac/dc, different voltages, etc. Most people dont realize this and think they can run any electronic device anywhere in the world as long as they have a physical adapter. Not true. You can buy a travel set of adapters for the plug and take this anywhere without having to worry about the type of power your using.</div>

They push the leading edge of lens-making in their effort to provide the "glass" that makes the world's greatest pictures.AF Nikkor lenses work with Nikon SLRs for optimal performance, even the very latest. The 17-35mm f2.8D ED-IF AF-S Zoom Nikkor Lens is a wide to telephoto 3.5x zoom lens ideal for landscape, full-length portraits, travel and portrait photographs. With a fast f2.8 maximum aperture at 24mm focal length, it provides a maximum 1:2 reproduction ratio from 35 to 85mm. Hybrid and molded-glass aspherical lens elements provide higher optical performance, while the nine-blade rounded diaphragm achieves a natural blur for out-of-focus elements. Filter attachment does not rotate during focusing or zooming.Nikon Super Integrated Coating ensures exceptional performanceTo enhance the performance of its optical lens elements, Nikon employs an exclusive multilayer lens coating that helps reduce ghost and flare to a negligible level. Nikon Super Integrated Coating achieves a number of objectives, including minimized reflection in the wider wavelength range and superior color balance and reproduction. Nikon Super Integrated Coating is especially effective for lenses with a large number of elements, like our Zoom-Nikkors. Also, Nikon's multilayer coating process is tailored to the design of each particular lens. The number of coatings applied to each lens element is carefully calculated to match the lens type and glass used, and also to assure the uniform color balance that characterizes Nikkor lenses. This results in lenses that meet much higher standards than the rest of the industry.Aspherical lens elementsNikon introduced the first photographic lens with aspherical lens elements in 1968. What sets them apart? Aspherical lenses virtually eliminate the problem of coma and other types of lens aberration--even when used at the widest aperture. They are particularly useful in correcting the distortion in wide-angle lenses. In addition, use of aspherical lenses contributes to a lighter and smaller lens design. Nikon employs three types of aspherical lens elements. Precision-ground aspherical lens elements are the finest expression of lens-crafting art, demanding extremely rigorous production standards. Hybrid lenses are made of a special plastic molded onto optical glass. Molded glass aspherical lenses are manufactured by molding a unique type of optical glass using a special metal die technique.Internal FocusingImagine being able to focus a lens without it changing in size. Nikon's IF technology enables just that. All internal optical movement is limited to the interior of the non-extending lens barrel. This allows for a more compact, lightweight construction as well as a closer focusing distance. In addition, a smaller and lighter focusing lens group is employed to ensure faster focusing. The IF system is featured in most Nikkor telephoto and selected Nikkor zoom lenses.Distance informationD-type and G-type Nikkors relay subject-to-camera distance information to AF Nikon camera bodies. This then makes possible advances like 3D Matrix Metering and 3D Multi-Sensor Balanced Fill-Flash. Note: D-type and G-type Nikkors provide distance information to the following cameras: Auto exposure; F6, F5, F100, F90X, F80, F75, F70, F65, F60, F55, F50, Pronea S, Pronea 600i, D2 series, D1 series, D100 and D70s/D70. Flash control; F6, F5, F100, F90X, F80, F75, F70, D2 series, D1 series, D100 and D70s/D70.What's in the Box:Lens, 72mm snap-on front lens cap, rear lens cap LF-1, bayonet hood HB-25.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B00005LE74-A3SEH9MH231NQQ')" id="toggleBtn-B00005LE74-A3SEH9MH231NQQ">Show more</button>

      <div class="reviewText">I bought this lens new about six months ago to use on my D3, and have used it now for four weddings.It is not quite as sharp as my 24-70mm f/2.8, when wide open, but when stopped down one stop, it is tach sharp. <mark>It is also much lighter which helps a lot at a long event, and it has more reach, making it great for parties and receptions.It autofocuses very quickly with the screw drive in the camera, and I never miss any action shots due to focus lag.</mark> It won't focus on some of the low-end Nikon DSLRs because they lack the drive screw.I don't recommend this lens for DX cameras, because 24mm is not usually wide enough on DX for many reception and party shots. In my opinion, the 16-85mm VR DX or even the 18-70 DX lens would be a better choice for a DX camera.The 24-85mm is also a very nice light weight travel lens for an FX camera.</div>

Further broadening your deployment options, the adapter supports most NOSs. Intel's innovative SingleDriver technology provides a common Gigabit Ethernet driver suite, while the product's backward compatibility with previous generations of Intel PRO/1000 network adapters reduces your support costs and simplifies installation and maintenance.This flexible, auto-sensing adapter works in a variety of bus types, including 64- or 32-bit PCI-X 1.0 or PCI 2.2 buses. It includes remote-management support (WfM, RIS, SNMP/DMI) as well as Intel's 82546 Gigabit controller with Interrupt Moderation, which ensures high performance, reliability, and low power use.The adapter's advanced cable diagnostics dynamically tests and reports network problems (error rate, cable length) and automatically compensates for cable issues (cross over cable, wrong pin-out/polarity). And compatibility with the large-send-off-load/TCP segmentation offload feature of Microsoft Windows Server 2003, 2000, and XP means you'll enjoy wire-speed performance with low CPU use.An advanced, newly expanded server features Intel ANS software, which increases uptime with redundant, teamed connections and scales bandwidth by balancing network traffic across multiple server connections. Switch Fault Tolerance and a Test Switch Configuration test compatibility and maintain uptime. Compatibility with Fast Ethernet reduces training costs and lets you ramp rollout quickly. You'll get Gigabit speeds on Category-5 cable networks without costly cable replacement.Finally, the adapter's auto-sensing, self-configuring 10/100/1000 Mbps performance permits migration to faster networks easily and inexpensively. The adapter will automatically sense when the network is able to support a faster speed and will self-configure to save IT staff time, money, and server downtime.Full-height and low-profile, the adapter includes screw-on brackets for easy placement. For installation in high-density 1U and 2U servers with a low-profile PCI, the full-height bracket can be easily swapped out and replaced by a shorter, low-profile bracket (both brackets supplied).</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B00006HX1V-A184QVOEZEVOW4')" id="toggleBtn-B00006HX1V-A184QVOEZEVOW4">Show more</button>

        <span class="summary">Amazing headphones</span>
      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">06 15, 2012</div>
      <div class="reviewText">Well, I can't praise these headphones enough, they sound amazing on the average computer, with nothing but a headphone output, and they shine like the sun through an amp and equalizer. They even work very well with the Ipod touch, which can tend to be underpowered for larger diaphragm headphones such as these, but once again, they didn't fail to perform. <mark>The voice coil is perfect for being able to keep things neat while sitting at a desk, but still being able to have your headphones on, and run over to the shelf, or even stretch them to a close-by room, not kidding!</mark> I just cannot get over the sound quality for such an inexpensive set of headphones. My only gripe is that within the first couple months, I've had to have the ear cups replaced by Sony (free of charge) and multiple people seem to have this problem. I bought a pair of Beyerdynamic cups:Beyerdynamic Velour Earcushions MDR7506 HeadphonesAnd they seem like they will last. Otherwise, the metal frame, and chamber are impressive, and the hefty cord and ends seem like they'll last a good long time. Although they're a little chunky/old fashioned to bring in public for some people, I don't have much of a problem with the design. It's very comfortable for long periods of wear as well.EDIT:These were purchased April 3rd of 2012, and the right earcup has stopped working as of September 14th 2013, they served me QUITE WELL indeed for the time I've had them but this is really unacceptable, especially considering all of the amazing reviews I've read for how long other customers have had these for. Has the quality of construction gone down? I'll try to update my review as for the experience of RMA'ing them or getting them repaired, and how much it costs.</div>
      <div class="question">what is voice coil</div>
      <div class="answer">Moving-coil The moving coil driver, more commonly referred to as a \"dynamic\" driver is the most common type used in headphones. The operating principle consists of a stationary magnetic element affixed to the frame of the headphone which sets up a static magnetic field. The magnetic element in headphones is typically composed of ferrite or neodymium. The diaphragm, typically fabricated from lightweight, high stiffness to mass ratio cellulose, polymer, carbon material, or the like, is attached to a coil of wire (voice coil) which is immersed in the static magnetic field of the stationary magnet. The diaphragm is actuated by the attached voice coil, when the varying current of an audio signal is passed through the coil. The alternating magnetic field produced by the current through the coil reacts against the static magnetic field in turn, causing the coil and attached diaphragm to move the air, thus producing sound. Modern moving-coil headphone drivers are derived from microphone capsule technology.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">This HDMI Cable works very well.  <mark>I use it connect my laptop to multiple televisions and the clarity and sound are great.Please note that the 6 feet may seem like a lot, but some TVs need to be connected in the back.</mark>  In this case, make sure you have space nearby to place your laptop during usage.  Also, (only) the first time you use it, you will probably have to default your speakers to the TV speakers so the sound works.</div>
      <div class="question">I was told that if I connect this cable from my pc tower to my flat screen pc monitor it would improve clarity on the monitor, Is that true? Thanks</div>

        <p>Amazon.com Product Description Whether the threat is in North America or abroad, the Beltronics Vect<span id="dots-B000246USU-A3IW6R4QM40YU5">...</span><span id="more-B000246USU-A3IW6R4QM40YU5" style="display:none">or 995 radar detector keeps you driving safely. As the industry leader in technology and innovation, the V995 accurately detects all US radar and laser bands (X, K, Ka) as well as the UK favorite-Ku. All bands are detected at the furthest possible distance including the newest "POP" mode Ka-band threat. With clear voice alerts, you can keep your eyes on the road, not the detector. And when it does alert, the mute button is right in easy reach on the included SmartPlug power cord. No need to leave the detector behind while traveling--we include the hard sided protective carrying case so the detector goes where you go.The flagship of the Vector series.Click to enlarge.Includes Smart Plug with easy-access mute/volume button.Click to enlarge.Easily install with quick-release windshield mount.Superior DetectionThe Vector 995 includes full X, K, SuperWide Ka, Ku and Safety Warning System radar capability, laser detection, patented Mute and AutoMute features, audible and visual band alerts, and all the performance you'd expect from Beltronics.Digital signal processing (DSP) technology and multiple laser sensors give you long-range performance, and greatly reduce the number of false alarms. On top of that, the Vector 995 is invisible to VG-2 radar detector detectors, keeping you one step ahead. It also features Highway/City sensitivity settings to tailor performance to your needs.Easy to UseThe rugged Vector 995 gives you control right at your fingertips. Patented Mute and AutoMute technology allows you to quickly silence alerts. Advanced programming lets you customize several features, and all controls are easily accessible on top of the device.Installation is also a snap: use the quick release Windshield QuickMount to attach it to your vehicle's windshield, and remove it in a snap. Don't want to leave it in your vehicle? No problem, Beltronics includes a travel case to keep it secure while you're on foot.AutoScan ModeThe V995's AutoScan mode provides long-range warning, with minimum false alarms. In this mode, the V995's internal computer continuously analyzes all incoming signals and intelligently filters out false alarms.Voice AlertsThe V995 provides digital voice announcements of radar and laser bands detected. If Safety Radar (SWS) is turned on, a safety radar message will also be announced.Smart Plug IncludedOnce you are notified to a threat, Beltronics' SmartPlug makes it easy to temporarily silence your radar detector with a handy mute button.Ultra-Bright LED DisplayDon't miss a visual alert with the 995's 280-LED alphanumeric display. Exclusive threat display tracks and displays multiple radar signals, including signal strength. You can also view Safety Warning System (SWS) messages about upcoming hazards, construction and more.Enjoy three different brightness settings or operate in dark mode if you'd prefer only audio alerts.Total Tracking LaserUnlike Radar signals, which are highly reflective, Laser signals have very poor reflective characteristics. Many of today's Laser detectors do not have the high sensitivity necessary to detect Laser within a large "field of view." The Vector 995 incorporates Beltronics' best laser detection, which uses twin laser ports to detect energy far outside the main laser beam--including off-axis signals--providing a 360-degree field of view. The alerts provided by your unit are the same whether signals are received from the front or rear.How Safety Radar WorksSafety Warning System (SWS) a modified K-band radar signal to alert users of Highway Construction or Maintenance, Highway Hazard Zone Advisories, Weather Related Hazards, Travel Information/Convenience, and Fast/Slow Moving Vehicles. The SWS safety radar system has 64 possible messages (60 currently allocated), all of which can be displayed on your Vector 995.What's in the BoxBeltronics V995 Vector Radar/laser Detector, carrying case, coiled power cord, quick release windshield mount, owner's manual</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B000246USU-A3IW6R4QM40YU5')" id="toggleBtn-B000246USU-A3IW6R4QM40YU5">Show more</button>

The lens is equipped with Image Stabilizer (IS) technology, which compensates for camera shake by providing the equivalent effect of a shutter speed two stops faster. The camera provides two IS modes: Stabilizer 1, the same mode featured on the EF 75-300mm lens, and Stabilizer 2, which steadies the image during horizontal or vertical panning. The lens is also half the weight of the 300mm f/2.8L IS, with a close focus distance of 4.9 feet. And like all of Canon?s fixed focal length L-series lenses above 135mm, it?s compatible with Canon's EF 1.4x II and 2x II Extenders.SpecificationsFocal length: 300mmMaximum aperture: f/4LLens construction: 15 elements in 11 groupsAngle of view: 8 degrees @ 15 feetFocus adjustment: Rear focusing system with USMClosest focusing distance: 4.9 feetFilter size: 77mmDimensions: 3.7 inches in diameter and 8.7 inches longWeight: 2.6 poundsWarranty: 1 yearExcellent optics and superb handling in a compact package with Image Stabilization. The IS allows safe hand holding at shutter speeds up to two stops slower than otherwise possible--making it even more useful in low-light levels. It&iacute;s less than half the weight of the 300mm f/2.8L IS, and it focuses to an incredibly close 4.9 ft/1.5m, filling the frame with a subject the size of a postcard. Like all of Canon&iacute;s fixed focal length L-series lenses above 135mm, it&iacute;s compatible with Canon&iacute;s EF Extenders 1.4x II and 2x II.Long and FastA telephoto lens is essential to any serious photographer. For sports action, you will need a fast shutter speed and a long focal length. A large maximum aperture allows a faster shutter speed. In this telephoto lens line-up, the focal lengths range from 135mm to 300mm. If you want compactness, choose a lens with a smaller maximum aperture.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B00009R6WW-A3B2ASDSPRNSD4')" id="toggleBtn-B00009R6WW-A3B2ASDSPRNSD4">Show more</button>

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">04 23, 2007</div>
      <div class="reviewText">I recently purchased this lens and have been extremely impressed with the results it produces. The "IS" works extremely well.I was a little concerned at first because the "IS" makes a little humming noise when in operation. I thought it was an issue at first due to the fact that my other "IS" lenses don't make the same noise, but found out it is completely normal for it to make the little humming noise that it does. I tested it out by turning off the "IS" and focusing in on a subject while hand holding my Canon 30D and I was moving around all over the place. Then I turned on the "IS" and it immediately made the image through the viewfinder much more steady and controled. It's nothing short of amazing.The focus is quiet and quick, what more could you ask for? It provides crystal clear shots as long as your shutter speed is over 1/30th (hand held with IS on). If you combine a tripod and this lens in "IS" mode, you will lose image quality, so ensure you turn off the "IS" if you are using a tripod.With the 1.4x teleconverter, it works great. Taking the 300mm and converting it to 420mm gives you a serious amount of "reach" for under $300 for the 1.4x teleconverter. <mark>The IS and the Autofocus work great with the 1.4x teleconverter, but I did notice the focus seemed to take just a touch longer, but it's so minor that most individuals probably wouldn't even notice.</mark> Combined with the 1.4x teleconverter, your F4 lens will convert to a F5.6 lens.With the 2.0x teleconverter, you get range that you wouldn't be able to get unless you paid huge $$$ for a 600mm prime. The IS works well with the 2.0x but you lose the option for Autofocus. So if you stack this 300mm lens with a 2.0x teleconverter you will be manually focusing all your shots. Combined with the 2.0x teleconverter, your F4 lens will convert to F8.Overall, this is a great lens at a great price, especially when you compare it to it's big brother the 300mm F2.8 that sells for nearly double the price of this lens. If you purchase this lens, you won't be disappointed.</div>
      <div class="question">It states that it is full time manual focus so does that mean there is no auto focus?</div>
      <div class="answer">One can set it to auto or manual focus on the lens and it's easy to go from one to the other. Also there are settings for stabilization settings and 1.5 meters to infinity, or 3 meters to infinity, handy if there's a fence in the way. I love this lens.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">So i've had the dual xdm7615 for a little over a year now.  <mark>I really like it, it plays back really well, it has many audio features such as loud on/off, 5 eq settings, 12 fm and am settings for radio, cd/mp3 cd playback, one feature that i really like because you have 20 cds on one, especially if you don't have an ipod or mp3 player,  there is a also a auxiliary jack that you are able to plug an mp3 player or iPod into which is nice.</mark>  It also looks really nice, all the buttons and volume wheel are illuminated blue but its not obnoxiously bright and the display is clear when its open.Now that i've given my pros here are my cons:The fact that it IS moveable poses problems.  sometimes the door doesn't open all the way or close all the way, i've had to push it along to get it to open and close recently.  depending on the angle of your dash, the display is either clearly visible or not at all because of the angle of the movable door.  I had this in my buick, which was a flat dash and it was easy to read, HOWEVA, in my new lancer its at an angle and it nearly impossible to read when open, which in my opinion, creates a hazard while driving.  I've also had problems with it in the winter time when it gets cold.  the volume doesn't want to go up when its really cold it goes back down to zero and takes almost 5 or 10 minutes to finally warm up and scroll correctly.  I also have had issues with it not voluming up and down correctly over the last week or so.  the buttons on the door also seem kinda flimsy when its open and need some force to push them in and change stations, or songs.  finally the clock is a bitch to change and it took me nearly 2 days to finally figure it out.All in all it does what i need it to do, I have it connected to a 500 watt dual amp and 2 12" dual subs and it sounds great.  I had no problems installing it myself in both cars and even with some of the flaws still get great sound out of it and you can hear me coming from at least a block away with it.  Its perfect for someone who is putting a system in their car for the first time and wants something that looks cool.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">In my home I have speakers in the main floor of the house and out on my deck as well.  <mark>While my receiver has speaker "a" and "b" selections, there is no individual volume control for each zone.</mark>  This resulted in my inside speakers being deafeningly loud and the deck speakers barely audible.  That's where this great little amp came into play.  This unit has made it possible to enjoy a steady volume of music both inside and out.  Once I tweaked the volume on the amp100 to match the inside of the house, I simply control the master volume on the receiver and both the inside and outside speakers adjust in tandem.  The fact that it automatically powers on as soon as I activate the "b" speakers makes it perfect for my application.</div>

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">01 5, 2014</div>
      <div class="reviewText">A teleconverter as other reviewers have said is essentially a lens magnifier.  There is no such thing as a free lunch and that expression is very true when it comes to teleconverters including this one.  To understand the limitations you have to know how it works.When a camera focuses it uses the widest available aperture of the attached lens to establish focus with the most light possible and then at the last moment it adjusts the lens aperture to the setting of the camera.  When you add a teleconverter such as this you are loosing 2 stops of light.  e.g. a f2.8 lens will be limited to shooting at f5.6.  This means that whereas a f2.8 lens can use all of the 2.8 aperture of light to establish autofocus when the teleconverter is attached it will be limited to f5.6.  This will significantly slow down your auto focus.  Most cameras need a minimum f stop number of f8 in order to establish focus - thus the reason that teleconverters are only recommended for L series and very fast lenses.  <mark>So for example if you had a variable aperture lens say f3.5 at the short end and f5.6 at the long end and you added this teleconverter to the lens you would have a maximum aperture of 7.2 to establish auto focus if you were zoomed in.</mark>  For moving subjects this would be far to slow to be useful for a moving bird.There is an additional consideration for purchasers to be aware of though.  It is best to purchase the teleconverter from the same manufacturer as the lens you intend to use it with.  The teleconverter makes electrical contact with both the camera and the attached lens and has to be able to communicate information between them such as focal length of the lens and information for the camera to focus the lens.  If you read thoroughly the compatibility information for teleconverters including this one you typically only find guarantees for lenses from the same manufacturer.  Limitations often include the need to manually focus your lens.  Many photographers are able to practice and see past this limitation but one should be aware of it before they invest in a teleconverter.The next limitation to mention is that as a magnifier a teleconverter will magnify every imperfection of your lens.  This means #1 you need to be using a clean lens but also #2 is back to the reason why you really must be using a very sharp, L or professional grade lens.  If you have the ability to be closer - you really should remove the teleconverter and move closer - the picture quality will be much better.  Teleconverters really do diminish image quality and the 2x does more so than the 1.4x alternative.The primary uses for a teleconverter are wildlife and sports photography.  If you were to consider a night high-school football game even under the lights would be hard to photograph with one of these attached.  With a small max aperture in the range of 5.6-7.2 depending on your lens and the need to freeze fast paced action you will need to also have a fast shutter speed which leaves you needing to crank up your ISO.  Generally modern DSLRs are good at handling high ISO's but at least for me I don't like to shoot with my canon 70D higher than 800 iso due to the noise that is introduced.  Sure you can improve it in post - but I would rather not have to do that - and coupled with the reduced picture quality introduced from the teleconverter it can be a problem.Knowing all of the above I still purchased the teleconverter as a stop gap until I could buy the lens I really wanted.  I returned it after 1 day.My first impression of the lens is that it was far lighter than I expected.  I own both the tamron 24-70 f/2.8 and the 70-200 f/2.8 (which I used with this TC) and they have a very solid build and weight to them.  Based on the build of these lenses I expected a bit more heft to the TC.  That said there is no need to have the extra weight if it isn't needed.After a couple hours of shooting with the teleconveter I decided to return it.  The biggest problem for me was that I could not shoot on continuous mode - my second shot would always produce an error saying that the lens lost connection with the camera.  It is very frustrating to drive 2 hrs to sit in the cold to watch eagles diving for fish to have one heading straight at you with a fish in its talons only to have your camera loose connection with the lens.  As best as I can tell this was a defect in the teleconverter as I have not read of others having this issue.  When you add in all of the other limitations that I spoke of this is simply not a piece of gear I would recommend investing it.The one use I found where the teleconverter allowed me to take good clear pictures was perched birds at about 30-50ft in good light.  For my purposes it just isn't what I am looking to capture.If anyone has questions about this review of my experiences please let me know.</div>
      <div class="question">How does the auto focus perform with this teleconverter?</div>
      <div class="answer">It works really well. Between my friend and I, we have the Canon 6D and 7D and use it all the time with both. Works perfect with auto focus. This is ALWAYS on my camera!</div>

      <div class="reviewText">The Targus CityGear TCG650 backpack has got a lot of room thanks to all of the pockets, it should be plenty of room for anything you need to take to classes.Since most people these days just take a tablet with them they can use the laptop compartment for other things like a binder and just use the built-in tablet pocket for their tablet.The CityGear bag is made of nylon so it's sturdy and well made and it even comes with a lifetime limited warranty from Targus where they will repair or even replace the backpack for you.The straps are probably the most important part of the bag, after all they're meant to carry the load on your shoulders. The straps on this bag are thick and very well padded making them comfortable for long periods of use with heavy loads. The back of the bag is thick and padded for comfort too making it a great combination for comfort with the padded straps.The price of the Targus CityGear varies greatly depending where you look,here on Amazon it's less than $50, but overall it's a great bag and worth it if you need a lot of space to carry your stuff with you and are looking for a good deal. <mark>The bag expands greatly, it's much larger than it looks when empty.The CityGear is a bag that can be used by students but it also looks good enough for business uses.The one thing that does bother me about the CityGear is I don't know if it's water resistant or waterproof as nowhere I look mentions if it is or not.</mark> One would assume as since it's nylon it's at least water resistant to some extent but it would be nice if it was actually mentioned somewhere.Bottom line is that it's an inexpensive bag especially when compared to others out there.Pros:+Lots of pockets for all your stuff+Separate tablet pocket+Well padded all aroundCons:-Might be waterproof or water resistant?</div>

I have to say I am very impressed. They fit both my ears and my girlfriends very well, and she has small ears. My ears don't get sore at all with these even when wearing them for extended periods of time. I have never had a problem with these falling out, and have even accidentally yanked on the cord while running and they still did not fall off. As an added bonus, if you don't turn them up to loud you can still hear sounds around you while listening to your music, offering a much safer running experience. <mark>I use them with my iPhone and have been able to talk on the phone using these headphones, not sure if they have a microphone or not, but it works and the sound is clear on the other end.</mark></div>

      <div class="reviewText">Looks nice yes. But, that is about where it ends. Tuning is very difficult because the turns ratio between the thumb wheel and tuning capacitor is too course. Just a small rotation of the thumb wheel causes too much change of the tuning capacitor making it hard to hit the center point of a signal. Since AM tuning is non-linear, the effect is more pronounced at the high end of the AM band. Also, a typical pair of headphones with a stereo plug will not fit the radio's earphone jack. This is because both the radio and headphone jack are mono, not stereo. <mark>Sadly, for just a few cents more per unit, this could have been a very enjoyable stereo radio that works with existing stereo headphones.</mark> As it is, it's little more than a child's toy. On a positive note, the use of two AA cells rather than the typical 9 volt battery indicates a well designed and efficient circuit. This should enhance battery life as well as replacement cost efficiency. Summary: Impossible to use with stereo headphones. Ok for use as a cheap emergency radio to be kept with emergency supplies, etc. But, I would not recommend for every day use.</div>
      <div class="question">Stereo? Is this thing supposed to be in stereo on the headphones?</div>
      <div class="answer">No, your radio is not defective, this is not a stereo radio, it is only mono, there is no stereo sound (right and left channels) only mono (single channel) sound. If you use \"regular\" headphones with this radio you will only hear one side of the headphones, that is normal for this radio. If you want to hear both ears of the headphones you will need to split the wires at the connector; two negative (ground) together and two positive together like if they are only one speaker. Now you will be hearing in both sides of the headphones in full mono sound. Or just buy a 3.5 mm mono plug to stereo jack adapter ($3.00 at ebay) and you are done.</div>

      <div class="reviewText"><mark>This is my first Galaxy S3 case I got.</mark> I wanted a case that was cheap enough where I wouldn't feel bad buying. The purpose is to find a well respected case brand that can offer great protection (from my 5 year old) after which I may change into a better case in the future as more manufacturers make cases and the selection is wider.First impression: Felt just like an Incase case with the smooth matte finish. Very sturdy and protects the phone well. This pretty much doubles the weight of the phone and so the phone feels sturdy and protected in the hands. I can definitely feel it in my pocket now. The buttons are cushy and easy to press. I wouldn't be worried if I dropped the phone.Things I notice of why I am only giving it 4 stars: As mentioned by another reviewer, it does collect pocket dust easily and is not easy to rub off with your hands. Maybe a cloth will help. The silicon on the two sides of the case where the buttons are easy to move around. This is the nature of soft silicon, but it would have been better if that area was a little stiffer instead of moving around. It would have been nice if the silicone was built with out a separate mold. I hate lines. Another thing is that the silicon at the top of the case does not look as clean and smooth as the bottom. I'm not sure why, maybe a molding issue, but it doesn't bother me all that much.I think it's a great deal for the price. Will have to see how the case holds up after a few weeks of use. Hopefully the paint won't peel like my Incase did (iPhone) awhile back. One note, another reviewer said they didn't get the "Acase" logo on the back of their case, but mine had it. No big deal for me.</div>

The receiver delivers 100 watts RMS per channel x 2 for strong, clear sound across the audible spectrum--even at low listening levels. The company has lowered the amplifier's distortion relative to the previous model (the RX-4105), to less than 0.08 percent, while also giving the receiver a new layout borrowed from its higher-end components.The RX-4105 uses totally discrete amplifiers for all channels (TDAS) to maintain its high power and low distortion. Use the receiver's A and B clip-type speaker outputs to power 2 different rooms, or to biwire a pair of speakers for more efficient amplification (with A outputs driving the woofers, for instance, and the B outputs driving the tweeters--make sure your speakers are compatible if this is a key feature for you).The receiver also offers a handy 25-key remote control and switching for 2 pair of loudspeakers. Audio inputs switch between and amplify up to 4 additional components, including 2 requiring both inputs and outputs (such as a cassette deck and a VCR). The built-in AM/FM tuner features 30 station presets and auto station setup.Other features include bass and treble tone controls, a dimmable fluorescent display, and a .25-inch headphone jack for private listening.What's in the BoxSherwood RX-4105 receiver, remote control, AC power supply cord, FM indoor antenna, AM loop antenna set, and owner's manual.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B0002EPWC0-A2CY0QCZOY787L')" id="toggleBtn-B0002EPWC0-A2CY0QCZOY787L">Show more</button>

      <div class="description">
        <p>In 1990, Canon's first EOS Rebel revolutionized photography by making SLR excitement available to ev<span id="dots-B0000C8VEK-A1Q6IGTQ01JAZV">...</span><span id="more-B0000C8VEK-A1Q6IGTQ01JAZV" style="display:none">eryone. In the decade that followed, the Rebel grew and evolved to give its legions of fans even more photographic freedom.  Now the Rebel achieves its ultimate evolution. Equipped with Canon's exclusive "digital trinity"--a 6.3-megapixel CMOS sensor, Digic imaging processor, and compatibility with over 50 of Canon's superb EF lenses--the Digital Rebel breaks definitively through every remaining barrier to truly deliver photography without limits. Create memorable images no matter what your level of experience. Nurture your creativity with easy controls and a world of EOS accessories. Share and reproduce your images with state-of-the-art digital freedom. The world's first affordable, premium-quality digital SLR makes it all possible.Capture Any Shot the Way You See It--BrilliantlyThe seven-point wide-area AF system makes focusing quick and accurate, even when your subject is off center. Seven focusing points are laid out in a cross pattern that's visible on the clear, uncluttered viewfinder. You can let the camera detect your subject and choose the proper focusing point--it will then be illuminated for no-surprise focus. The Digital Rebel supports your own creative vision as well, by letting you choose your own focusing point. Dioptric adjustment lets you shoot comfortably with or without your glasses.Dazzling Resolution: 6.3-Megapixel CMOS SensorThe camera's large-format, high-resolution 6.3-megapixel CMOS sensor delivers images that will astonish you with their depth and detail. Every image is remarkably detailed throughout the full dynamic range, from highlights to shadows. The large sensor has a 3:2 aspect ratio to give you the familiar compositional feel and classic image proportions of a 35mm camera.Canon's more than 60 years of photographic experience went into the CMOS sensor's invention and refinements and the way it works in perfect tandem with the imaging processor. Together, they virtually eliminate stray light and off colors. Even long exposure images, like of city lights against a night sky, are clear and virtually noise-free.The sensor supports an extensive range of ISO speeds. This allows you to quickly compensate for shifting light conditions, as if you had film of various speeds actually built into the camera. In short, the CMOS sensor allows the Digital Rebel to achieve film-quality images while offering all the advantages of digital technology.RAW and JPEGIn RAW mode, every shot is captured as both a RAW and middle/fine JPEG file. RAW files render the most detailed printed images, while less-detailed JPEGs are also smaller, making them perfect for sending via e-mail and viewing on computer screens. Having both kinds of files recorded automatically means that whatever you decide to do with your final images, you're covered.The Speed to Capture the Shots That Won't WaitHighly responsive autofocus makes for shooting excitement. The camera automatically employs one of three AF systems to deliver fast, spot-on focus in any situation. One-Shot AF is the best choice for still subjects, locking in focus as you press the shutter button halfway. AI Servo AF tracks active subjects, predicting their movement. AI Focus AF switches between One-Shot AF and AI Servo AF when subjects start and stop--perfect for children, pets, and other unpredictable subjects. A high-speed, 2.5 frame-per-second motor drive powers the continuous shooting mode, letting you capture split-second action sequences with a burst of up to four shots.The DIGIC Imaging ProcessorCanon's exclusive DIGIC chip gives the Digital Rebel spectacular image quality, natural color reproduction, and fast, responsive handling. The general-purpose imaging processors used by most digital cameras perform pixel operations one at a time. DIGIC, however, operates in parallel mode for exceptionally fast processing. Fast processing combines with high-capacity buffering to eliminate waiting time between shots, so when the great shots are ready, you are too. Newly developed antinoise/high-resolution algorithms make stray light and off-color pixels minimal to non-existent. Feel free to enlarge and crop with exceptional results.ISO FlexibilityDigital Rebel's digital component performance is impressive, offering you many advantages. ISO speed can be set from 100 to 1600, so when lighting conditions change, the camera can change with them. A conventional SLR would have to hold multiple rolls of film at various speeds to match this flexibility!Works Smart on Its Own, Hands Over Control When You Want ItThe Digital Rebel's 35-zone, AF point-linked Evaluative Metering Sensor and three metering modes make the art of controlling exposure as easy or advanced as you want. Thirty-five-zone evaluative metering ensures accurate, consistent exposure, taking into account lighting extremes and subject position through the active focusing point. Whether the light is bright and sunny or darkly atmospheric, whether it comes from the front or the back, exposure is detailed, natural and flattering.Control is there when you want it, with Partial Metering to bring extra sensitivity to high-contrast situations, or Center-Weighted Average Metering in manual exposure mode. Creative exposure options go even further with illumination from the built-in flash or an optional EX-series Speedlite: you can use Canon's most advanced flash metering system, E-TTL, plus FE Lock, High-Speed Sync and Wireless E-TTL Autoflash.A Fun Companion, At Your Side Wherever the Day Takes YouThe Digital Rebel is compact and lightweight, with a secure rounded grip. In fact, it feels so good in your hand you'll want to bring it everywhere. Operation feels familiar and intuitive, whether you're new to digital, new to SLR cameras, or even new to photography itself.The mode dial makes one-handed shooting comfortable, with digital and shooting controls easily accessed and cross keys located right under your thumb to handle the operations you'll use most. The LCD screen is big and informative, and you can even adjust the brightness setting. Menus are written in plain language and tabbed on a single screen--no scrolling necessary. The highly intelligent built-in flash pops up and fires automatically in appropriate modes for point-and-shoot convenience.The Versatility of SLR Photography with Point-and-Shoot SimplicityThe right-side-mounted mode dial makes one-handed shooting comfortable, and 12 versatile shooting modes let you make the call: shoot fully automatically, master a given situation with a Programmed Image Control mode, experience the excitement of manipulating shutter and aperture combinations, or go fully manual. Additional advanced exposure controls include AE Lock, FE Lock and AutoExposure Bracketing, which records three consecutive exposures for one shot to make sure you get the effect you want. And with a touch of the depth-of-field preview button, you can check the front-to-back sharpness of an image just before shooting. Illumination is always flattering thanks to automatic flash output reduction in backlit daytime conditions and built-in redeye reduction.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B0000C8VEK-A1Q6IGTQ01JAZV')" id="toggleBtn-B0000C8VEK-A1Q6IGTQ01JAZV">Show more</button>

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">04 10, 2004</div>
      <div class="reviewText">Ok, first off I have to say that I bought my camera about 3 days ago.  <mark>I have used it for several personal events, but I have not used it yet to do the main thing I bought it for, which is sports and action photos.I have read some great reviews about this camera, and overall I am very pleased with it.</mark>  But I do think that there are 2-3 items that I should address that annoy me about this camera, which I did not realize before buying.First, I came from a Canon EOS A2, which had most features that I ever needed.  About my only complaint on this camera was that the flash-synche wasn't quite fast enough for me.  But that was minimal.Now, with the Digital Rebel, I realize I am taking a step down in the EOS &quot;family line&quot; but I was hoping the Rebel would be upgraded as such with the features that it's predecessors lacked.  Some were, and some weren't.The first lacking feature is the inability to change metering modes.  The camera has preset metering modes in the different &quot;creative&quot; and &quot;preset&quot; settings.  I cannot change from center-weighted metering to full-frame metering in Tv (shutter priority) Av (aperature priority) or full program (P)  The camera presets the metering for each of these modes and does not give me the option to change.The same is true for Single Shot and AI Servo focussing.  I cannot tell the camera to focus on a moving subject, unless in the &quot;Sports&quot; mode, and then in this mode, I cannot set the shutter speed manually.  In Tv, the camera &quot;senses&quot; whether you are following a subjext or not, and focuses either single-shot or AI Servo, depending on the movement of the subject.  But I have noticed that it takes a small amount of time to detect the subject moving.  After this, the lightning-fast EOS focussing system kicks in and all is well.These may be minor features to most, but they are features I became accustomed to with the EOS A2, and that camera is several years old.  I was hoping this new and improved rebel would be more munipulative, but it is not.Overall I would still rate this camera at 4 stars.  The photo quality is outstanding and the ease of use is great.  The focusing still screams and I can use my former lenses.  I just wish I would have known about these other features before-hand.</div>
      <div class="question">does it take good action shots?</div>
      <div class="answer">yes, when you have everything set correctly</div>

      <div class="reviewTime">10 13, 2003</div>
      <div class="reviewText">I notice another reviewer called the Speedlite 220 the perfect companion for your G1; I thought of it as the perfect companion for my G2. <mark>Whichever camera you have, the Speedlite 220 is indeed the perfect way to get better illuminated flash photos and extend battery life in your G-series camera.The single most important thing you can do to get rid of red eye and insure that your flash photography subjects don't have that flat, pasty-faced, deer-caught-in-the-headlights look is to seperate the camera from the flash.</mark> (You'll need Canon's off-camera extension cord for this) You can shoot with the camera in one hand and hold the flash in the other, or use a bracket to hold them. Or you can get creative, bouncing the flash off the walls, lighting behind your subject, etc. It's great for providing fill flash on sunny days, lighting shadows- and with digital cameras it costs you next to nothing to experiment with lighting and get immidiate feedback.The 220 talks to all the G-series cameras (as well as all modern Canon SLRs) so you can concentrate on lighting and composition and let the camera worry about exposure. Add a couple sets of rechargeable AA cells and a small charger- cheap these days- and you have an inexpensive but powerful lighting studio. Some may recoil at the price- after all, you can get a tiny flash unit for half or a quarter the cost- but the ability to integrate withe the camera electronics are well worth it.</div>

      <div class="answer">I just came back from a vacation and shot over 1000 photographs using a G9 and the 220ex. I did not notice any red eyes in my photographs during evening photographs. I used the flash on all my shots, to fill in and they all came out great.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">I got so frustrated with wireless headsets that I went strictly to wired for several years. This one had such good feedback and was such a good price that I thought I'd give it a go.My callers say that the headset sounds much better than the (cheap) wired headsets I was using. <mark>The headset holds a good charge, sounds great, is easy to connect to my Android phone, and folds up easy.</mark>  The buttons are large enough to find and push easily.  I like this much, much better than those small bluetooth sets that hang off your ear. I can actually use my cell phone for calling again!Only thing that is a little weird is how it sits on your head. Basically it just goes around the back of your neck, which I'd imagine fits most people pretty well. However, the band does rub against collars, so if I'm wearing a jacket with a collar it can push the headset off my head when I move my head backwards towards the jacket.  If I pull the back down to touch the lower part of my neck it helps.</div>
      <div class="question">How is the sound clarity on this headset for listening to? Good to bad?</div>
      <div class="answer">I was using a pair of Bose ear buds. I like these way better. They sound very good you will not be disappointed.</div>

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">09 29, 2008</div>
      <div class="reviewText">Sennheiser 555 is the best sub-$100 full sized open headphone.  I've had the HD-555 for about 6 months now, and here are my thoughtsPros:= comfortable fit---- circumaural, they cover your ears with plushy Velour material---- glasses friendly---- hours of comfort without much agitation= Superior Sound Stage, spacious---- sound stage will blow your mind.  <mark>Separation of frequencies in instruments are precise and crisp---- high dynamic frequency spectrum---- ridiculous spacious; when listening, it feels as if you have two large speakers suspended next to your ears.= Portable units friendly- works well with ipods and mp3 player, but portable amp is recommended.= very musical---- handles bass and low frequencies very well.++++++++ deep rich bass with a tight punch++++++++ bass is not over powering, doesn't muffle the treble---- treble and mids really come out++++++++ handles acoustic instruments and vocals like magic---- cleans highs, crystal clear= user replaceable parts---- always nice to haveCons:= no isolation or noise cancellation---- these are open headphones, noise comes in, noise goes out---- blast these cans in the library and you'll probably get some stares---- blast these cans in the train or in traffic and your music will get muffled with the surroundings.---- they are great when there is not sound around, but when there is, it is a deal breaker.= not portable---- long cord (10ft)---- gets really sweaty in the summer---- the 3.5mm/6.3mm adapter is really annoying with using it with portable mp3/cd players= average build quality---- nothing too fancy, just plastic here and thereHD-555 won't disappoint!for references, I own:HD-555, DT-880, HD-280, ER6i, SR-80</mark></div>
      <div class="question">Hows the bass? Hows the bass on these headphones?</div>
      <div class="answer">Not great, in all honesty if you're looking for more bass go with with the hd280pro's. the HD555's are no slouch, but they're meant to be a natural warm listening experience, not bass heavy. I do think they're balanced but wouldn't mind just a tad more low end, and they'd be perfect, but I prefer the open ear design (kinda seems to keep ears a little cooler vs closed designs as well. I altered the 555 to 595 mod (youtube) by punching a few holes into the rectangular pads hidded on the inside of the cans to help a tiny bit with bass response, without removing them all together (your ears will become treble fatigued with them totally removed, if you listen at higher levels, I've found.. especally if you use an external amplifier for that added punch)</div>

      <div class="reviewText">The Exact thing you need for D8 Sony DCR-TRV Models.  Really.

I just wish I would have bought it when it was $9.99 at my local store years ago.  The shipping is about the same price of the item, but good luck finding one at your local store.

      <div class="reviewText">I shopped all around and read hundreds of reviews of hand held  cb s.  I used to travel aback and forth from Tempe az to Chicago when I was in college.  I used a  mounted, cb for eight years and I relied heavily on it to keep me awake and interested during the 36 hour trip.  So, nostalgia set in before Xmas and I bought this unit. And a second one for my son who commutes to college.  The reviews are correct on the short range of the wand antenna on the unit.  Not good.  I bought a lil Wilson magnet antenna.  <mark>On the highway today, my radio checks indicated I was getting a transmission range of 5-8 miles.</mark>  Not bad at all.  Brought me back to the college commute.  I recommend this device for any of us aging baby boomers (and their kids)  And i should add that the noaa weather channel is great.  Cb radios saved my life a couple of times.  I'm back  in!!!</div>
      <div class="question">So with the adapter, you can plug the radio into something and it will use your car antenna or some other antenna and get further range? How far?</div>
      <div class="answer">Range depends on the CB antenna used, and location. With just 5 watts, you could get 5miles if you were on the flatlands, or a desert. Out on the countryside maybe 3miles. In the city about a mile, maybe. If you use it inside the car with just the rubber duck antenna supplied, virtually nothing. You need a CB antenna mounted on the roof of your car. Cobra has a 36\" magnet mount CB antenna that works very well. Model HG A1500. In addition, you can use a linear amplifier to increase range (though it's illegal, it's commonly used) An RM KL-30 would increase your output to about 30watts, this increasing the range. Good luck.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">I know the TL is currently being upstaged by Sony's new Xperia Z but the TL is also an amazing little powerhouse of a smartphone.That being said, I had a somewhat difficult time finding a suitable case that I could take with me on the road and feel secure that my phone was being protected to the max.I was looking for an Otter case (which they don't make for the TL) when I came across the Ballistic case on Amazon...so I decided to take a chance and buy the Ballistic case.I'm glad I did. <mark>Very nicely designed with rubbery gel corners and thick materials on the backside of the case.Two pieces fit snugly around the phone like a glove and allows for easy button pushing.If you have a Xperia TL and need maximum protection then this is the case for you!</mark></div>
      <div class="question">Would this case fit the Sony Xperia TL 30at?</div>
      <div class="answer">Yes because that is the same exact phone that I have. Sorry I didn't put that in my review.</div>

Among the receiver's audio features are a discrete circuit configuration that separates the audio signals for greater clarity; A/B speaker selection, which lets the listener choose an alternate pair of speakers; and binding post speaker terminals that provide a pure, high-quality connection.As with many receivers, the AG-790 also boasts a quartz PLL-synthesized AM/FM tuner with 30 AM and 30 FM presets. Thanks to the tuner, listeners can easily locate their favorite stations or browse among the dozens of presets (enough for virtually any size market). Users also have the choice of using the manual or auto-tuning. Other add-ons include a multifunction fluorescent display, a front-panel headphone jack for private listening, and a full-function remote control. The receiver measures 17.12 by 5.47 by 13.19 inches (W x H x D) and weighs 21.2 pounds.What's in the BoxAG-790 receiver, remote control, user's manual.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B00009K087-A2HCYNTJEAA40W')" id="toggleBtn-B00009K087-A2HCYNTJEAA40W">Show more</button>

      <div class="reviewText">Purchased via Amazon 9+ months ago, and I was satisfied for the first few months.  It did the job as my music sounded fine.  But problems arose.  <mark>It has inputs for Tape/Aux/CD/Tuner/Phono ~ and I installed 3 of the inputs (Aux/CD/Tape).</mark>  Now it won't tell one from another - sometimes it plays CD when you push Aux, or Aux when you push Tape, othertimes it takes a power-off/power-on to find the Aux source.  And the volume control is wacko - the volume gauge runs from 1 to 62, and I play cd's at around level 15, the aux. source at around 30 and Tapes at 40 ~ all to the same level of loudness.  When switching to CD after an Aux. input I get BLASTED if I don't remember to turn down the volume.So my sister loaned me a Denon (a higher-end stereo receiver line) and I was surprised at the step up (cost to value.)  Suddenly I'm aware the Teac had (at best) a poor surround system, and a poor interface, and no subwoofer, central speaker, functionable surround options.  So was the Denon worth $130?  Yes, the quality of sound to the main speakers is fine, and worth $130 if it worked properly (I obviously got a defective unit.)  But maybe I should have saved up  and gotten a Denon (or equivalent higher-end) in the first place ($500) ~ having access to surround, central, subwoofer etc. is wonderful.</div>

Switch the software into Business mode, then go over to the Action section. In the list of actions is \"Set Audible Alarm\". Set the value to 1 (even if it's already 1, overwrite it), then execute the command. After a second or two, the program will unfreeze, and it will be completely silent when it loses power from then on!\"</div>

One for disposable batteries, another for rechargeable. The rechargeable battery holder has an AC adapter included. It comes with a steel belt clip. Though, be careful it can easily scratch your belt.The radio isn't very loud, even with the sound at max level. The only time I have any issues hearing it is when I have a window cracked. It does come with a jack for headphones or an external speaker. This Midland model also does not have an ANL (Automatic Noise Limiter), and does receive interference from time to time.The range is to be expected for a hand held radio. <mark>Using it with the rubber antenna inside of your vehicle you can expect 1/4 - 3/4 mile range depending on the time of day and terrain.</mark> You get better range outside of your vehicle. Excellent for use on ATVs. If you plan to use this radio in your vehicle, it would be wise to purchase an antenna. I purchased a magnetic antenna for portability: [...]</div>
      <div class="question">So with the adapter, you can plug the radio into something and it will use your car antenna or some other antenna and get further range? How far?</div>
      <div class="answer">Range depends on the CB antenna used, and location. With just 5 watts, you could get 5miles if you were on the flatlands, or a desert. Out on the countryside maybe 3miles. In the city about a mile, maybe. If you use it inside the car with just the rubber duck antenna supplied, virtually nothing. You need a CB antenna mounted on the roof of your car. Cobra has a 36\" magnet mount CB antenna that works very well. Model HG A1500. In addition, you can use a linear amplifier to increase range (though it's illegal, it's commonly used) An RM KL-30 would increase your output to about 30watts, this increasing the range. Good luck.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">I've gone through three different USB 2.0 hubs for iDevices in the last six months and this is the first to actually work; with caveats:The two "powered" 1.2A USB ports that are supposed to be i-Device ready will NOT fully charge the devices when the Macbook is powered on; but instead, use a "trickle charge". That means that if you are using your devices while they are plugged in, you'll likely see their charge progress VERY slowly. D-Link recommends turning off your Macbook to get a full charge (at which point, it becomes just a standard i-Device power adapter).Normal charge times for a 32GB iPad through the Macbook USB 2.0 port is about 1%/min. On a trickle charge, it's about 1%/hr; perhaps longer (took all day to go from 93% to 100%). <mark>You'll also see an "iPad not charging" warning on your iPad; however, this is covered in the documentation (but not in the product description); and just means that the iPad is getting a very small charge (almost negligible) from the USB port.In other words, the D-Link WILL charge both an iPhone and an iPad plugged in at the same time with the MacBook powered on, albeit, very slowly.However, this is one of the few devices that will allow you to connect two iDevices to a single USB 2.0 port on your Mac, get a charge, and be able to sync to iTunes through it.</mark> It handles both my iPhone-5 and iPad-2 as well as a Seagate 1.5TB portable HD without any issues.</div>

His rantings were picked up by our PC audio wires and came through too loud and clear. I added this choke but it couldn't prevent the CB transmissions.I was able to get our apartment complex to tell him to stop transmitting. This adapter is quite inexpensive so I'd recommend you buy it and give it a try. It's easy to install too. And easy to remove if you wish.</div>

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">02 5, 2014</div>
      <div class="reviewText">For MODEL#: CD-340, ITEM#: 190048The description here (and on the sites of some other major retailers) reads: "Compatible with CD players and CD-ROM drives. Not for laptops and Blu-ray."When I received this, the back of the package reads: "For use with CD/DVD players, laptops, and standard gaming systems."  Maxell's own online store and some other retailers also state this.An e-mail to Maxell support questioning this discrepancy received a prompt response that said in part "It is NOT safe for use in LAPTOP computer optical disc drives or with Blu-Ray drives (Blu-Ray drives use a laser lens that sits much closer to the disc, so do most laptop cd or dvd drives.)"Not helping is at least four different incarnations of packaging for the same model and item#.  (The package I received from Amazon does not have the MAXLINK PRO heading shown in the image here.)Anyway, completely throwing caution to the wind, I put this into my desktop drive. <mark>The seemingly pointless voice "instructions" say "Please select track three and press play when the music stops"When you go to track three you are immediately told:  "The cleaning is now complete"  You're then treated to a couple of more minutes of music - because that's why you bought this, right?I went back to track two which runs for 46 minutes so I'm guessing that's the cleaning track.CD-340 didn't correct the problem I'm having with my desktop drive but that doesn't mean it didn't clean the lens.</mark>  I would feel more confident of that if I at least felt certain it's meant to clean a desktop drive.  Who knows?</div>
      <div class="question">why does it say to skip to track 3 when music stops? Why doesn't it say to go to track 2?</div>
      <div class="answer">As soon as the explanation of track one is over the cleaning will start on track 2,once the cleaning time is finished you can take it out or leave it in and listen to the music playing,but it's the cleaning that has to be turned off at the alotted time for best quality,it's your option to let tarck 3 play,it's a great product and does the job. rich</div>

      <div class="description">
        <p>Binoculars come in a wide range of shapes and sizes these days, and  an even wider range of prices. <span id="dots-B00008Y0VN-AAI8G6LM4CIFP">...</span><span id="more-B00008Y0VN-AAI8G6LM4CIFP" style="display:none"> It's easy to spend less than $100 or more  than $500 for what may appear to be, at least outwardly, comparable models.   While they may look the same, they are probably quite different on the  inside.Recently, the binocular market has seen a flood of giant binoculars at  prices that were unheard of just a few years ago.  In general, giant  binoculars are defined as those that magnify the view 10 times or more and  have 70-mm or larger front (objective) lenses.  It used to be that the least  expensive giant binoculars cost in excess of $150, even $200.  All that  changed not long ago, when the bottom fell out of the price cellar.  Now,  several companies import giant binoculars that sell for half that, or less.Celestron's 15x70 SkyMaster binoculars are one of the leaders in the  low-price giant binocular arena.  They certainly sound good on paper.  The  SkyMasters include multicoated optics and BaK-4 internal prisms, two  features that promise brighter, better images, and key points to look for  when judging a pair of binoculars.  They also come with an adapter for  attaching them to a photo tripod, which is a must to use them to their  fullest, and a soft carrying case.  But just because they are cheap doesn't  always mean they are worth the price.  Would it be better to save up for a  more expensive pair?To find the answer, I had an opportunity recently to judge the SkyMasters  against a pair ofFujinon 16x70 FMT-SX binoculars, one of  the finest pairs of giant binoculars sold today.  Like the SkyMasters, the  Fujinons feature BaK-4 prisms, but also have fully multicoated optics.  As a  general rule, superior coatings mean superior image sharpness and contrast.   But then, that should be expected, given that the Fujinons cost many times  more than the Celestrons.While the Fujinons were clearly the better performer, the Celestron  SkyMasters held up admirably.  Image brightness, quality, and contrast were  all remarkable considering their bargain price.  Although images were a  little soft across the outer 25% of the Celestron's field, the overall view  was impressive nonetheless.Some inexpensive binoculars have very sloppy focusing, causing the eyepieces  to tilt and shift.  Not so with the SkyMasters.  I found that their  center-focusing mechanism worked smoothly, with no apparently backlash or  wobble.  Eye relief (the distance you hold your eyes away from the eyepieces  to see the full field) is stated to be 18 mm, a good distance for higher  power binoculars and an important consideration if you must wear glasses  when viewing.  The SkyMasters are also light enough to support by hand for  short periods of time, although buyers would be well advised to mount them  on a sturdy photo tripod.The bottom line is, if you are considering a pair of giant binoculars,  whether for bird watching, stargazing, or another recreational use, and have  a limited budget, Celestron's giant 15x70 SkyMasters represent an excellent  value. --Phil Harrington, author ofStar WareandStar WatchPros:Exceptional value for the priceLight enough to support by handBaK-4 prismsMulticoated opticsCons:Outer 25% of the field is soft and a little blurryRequires a tripod to use for extended periods</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B00008Y0VN-AAI8G6LM4CIFP')" id="toggleBtn-B00008Y0VN-AAI8G6LM4CIFP">Show more</button>

      <div class="answer">Yes, first use the center adjustment to get it focused correctly for the left eye...now close your left eye and look only thru your right eye and adjust the right eyepiece until it comes into focus. Now you should be able to see clearly with both eyes!</div>

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">03 15, 2014</div>
      <div class="reviewText">after checking the other reviews on youtube, i decided to order this monitor.in my case i purchased from bizbuy, and they were able to ship directly to europe (cool!). the monitor was very well packed and arrived well.the monitor is huge! you will need a big desk and probably will no longer need, or have room for, two monitors. the overall width of the monitor is just under 27.5" or 70 cm.very important: this monitor will only work with a computer that supports a Dual-Link DVI connection and 2560x1600 resolution. this monitor does *not* have any other inputs such as HDMI, DisplayPort, etc. -- by eliminating the other input types, it helps to reduce the cost of the monitor. <mark>if you are using a modern Mac, you will need the Apple mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI adapter, part MB571Z/A, which is a bit pricy at $99.00 but it works well.i ordered the slightly more expensive pixel perfect version, which is allowed a couple defects, but in my case the monitor is indeed defect-free, yay :)the stand is very basic (black glass with a clear border area) but looks nice; i am using a book to increase the hight slightly, or i might add a VESA stand at a later date.the screen area is matte but the frame is glossy (piano-black).</mark> the glossy frame might be a slight nuisance for some people. the other minor nuisance item is the external power brick. i haven't found the OSD menu yet (if there is one!). there is a direct control of the brightness with an "up" and "down" button, and the max brightness is very good, comparable to my 350 nits monitor.i don't have any fancy test-tools but standard text and 1080p videos both look great. i believe one of the youtube videos talks about gaming performance. in any case, a great value for a 30" monster monitor, if it is compatible with your computer.this will hopefully be my last 2560x1600 monitor until UHD (3840xSomething) or 4k (4096xSomething) monitors become affordable, which may take a little while. UHD / 4k also require newer computers or display cards, so the upgrade cycle never ends...cheersupdate 1:monitor still running great, but had an error message on a mac playing HDCP content from iTunes (iTunes claims the monitor does not support HDCP and will not play protected videos on it). not sure if this is due to the monitor or the Apple adapter (see above), still need to investigate.</div>
      <div class="question">Is the screen matte or gloss?</div>
      <div class="answer">The one I received is matte, which seems to be the same that others I've read online (from other vendors than Amazon) have gotten.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">I wanted to split the VGA signal from our laptop to our plasma TV and a small LCD computer monitor in another room. Like others, I wasted a little money trying a standard VGA splitter 'Y' cable first. This might work if you wanted to split a VGA signal between two small monitors. In our case the monitor got perfect signal but the TV picture was ghosted and horrible. I knew we needed a powered VGA splitter, so I was glad I had bookmarked the Cables To Go 29550.This was a snap to set up and worked immediately to feed both our TV and monitor. The only small snafu I encountered was that I couldn't get our 42" TV and 17" computer monitor to play nicely together in resolution requirements. To get the best picture on our tv, the laptop's display settings for the "external monitor" need to be 1280 x 768. <mark>I guess because the laptop sees the splitter as a single device, if the TV and monitor don't share native resolutions then one or the other will suffer.</mark> I futzed around with the laptop's display settings trying to find a happy medium, before I settled on feeding the TV the proper resolution since we watch that more. The monitor's picture is beautiful, just slightly elongated.Anyway, I THINK that's what's going on...If anyone has another suggestion I'd love to hear it.Our setup:XP laptop --> Cables to Go 29550 powered VGA splitter -->1)HD15 SVGA Monitor Extension Cable, Male to Female with Ferrite Bead 1 ft-->Component video (YPbPr) / VGA To HDMI Converter With Auto Up-scale--> 42" plasma TV2)RiteAV - SVGA Monitor Cable with 3.5mm Audio - 10 ft.-->RiteAV - VGA Coupler / Gender Changer Female-Female--> 17" lcd computer monitorSure, it's a lot of work to figure it out and cable it up, and we can't watch all our favorite shows immediately. But we enjoy being pioneers in DIY internet tv, especially since it's saving us $70/month in satellite fees!</div>
      <div class="question">hook up my laptop to two monitors to the cable to go splitter box, i clone, use extened 1 an 2 button, have press f5, press crt, doesn't work, cable on my monitors r in the computor side or does it goes on the video side or what</div>
      <div class="answer">You would hook up your laptop to the Input side and your monitors to the output side. This box will only allow you to clone the output from your laptop. So from what I understand in your question, if you are using the extended feature of your laptop you would have: One display on your laptop and the other will be cloned between the two monitors.</div>

Like its predecessor, the XL1, this camera uses three separate 270,000 pixel CCDs (one for each primary color) for the best picture quality. The XL1S records digital audio, with two channels of 16 bit/48 KHz sound or four channels of 12 bit/32 KHz sound. The body is based on a magnesium-alloy frame for maximum durability. It ships with a 16x optical zoom lens with optical image stabilization, but is also compatible with other XL camcorder lenses. With an optional adapter, you can use Canon EF (EOS) still-camera lenses--some of which also feature optical image stabilization.The electronics of the XL1S have many advanced features, including a number of programmed AE modes, as well as both shutter and aperture priority modes. There are two different auto modes, one of which allows you to adjust any setting manually, if you want, and the other, which adjusts every setting automatically and lets you adjust nothing. A spotlight mode automatically compensates for difficulties when shooting a subject bathed in a spotlight. The computer-shooting mode gets rid of monitor flicker that happens when shooting a computer screen. There are also three different shooting modes: normal movie, digital photo, and frame movie. Normal movie mode is for any time you want to shoot video footage. Digital-photo mode records a still image for six seconds on the MiniDV tape and also captures any accompanying audio for a commentary track. The frame movie mode records 30 noninterlaced still images per second, instead of capturing 60 fps interlaced images. This mode isn't intended to be used for shooting video (playback may not look completely smooth). Rather, frame movie mode should be used as a burst, or continuous, shooting mode, like you'd find on a still camera.The XL1S offers many new and updated features over the XL1. There is a 16:9 shooting mode where electronic lines draw are displayed through the viewfinder so you can compose your shots flexibly for later conversion to HDTV, where 16:9 is the standard. SMPTE color bars help establish a proper color reference for shooting and editing. Interval recording lets you shoot time-elapsed motion video with intervals from 30 seconds to 10 minutes. Zebra patterns help you determine overexposed areas in your shot so you can adjust the aperture and shutter accordingly.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B00005NKXS-A3LIMGY5X0DUAO')" id="toggleBtn-B00005NKXS-A3LIMGY5X0DUAO">Show more</button>

      <div class="reviewText">This is a great product. An amazing camera all together.But if you trying to make a film and not just home movies, its lacking in the capturing footage area. <mark>It takes DVC tapes which I knew but I also assumed it had a SD card slot and a USB port.</mark> But it has neither, I would be unable to transfer any footage to my computer because none of them take Firewire cables anymore.This camera is old but still very relevant. But if you trying to make a movie your going to have your work cut out for you trying to movie the footage to a 2009 or new laptop. Im not sure when they stopped using firewire but most new laptops only have usb ports..</div>

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">11 29, 2010</div>
      <div class="reviewText">I am still waiting for the perfect ebook reader. I bought the Nook for these reasons: 1) It reads industry-standard ePub-format ebooks, 2) it's tightly integrated with the B&N; ebook store, 3) the ebooks are encrypted in a well-documented easily-understood format that is portable across multiple devices so they can be decrypted and read in, say, your iPad's Nook reader software, or even in a Sony Reader (with the very latest firmware), without having to be re-purchased because of DRM nonsense.The problem is that the Nook simply doesn't live up to its promise. The "paper-white" display is more an off-beige, and reflects light in a way that makes it hard to read with a reading light (necessary because it has no backlight, as is true for all ePaper devices). It's heavy and the buttons to change pages are hard to push, especially with gloved hands as you might have while reading outdoors on a cool day. The "5 day battery life" in reality for me has been a 1-day battery life, read a book, and it needs to be recharged, and be darn sure to turn it off. The thing freezes up and crashes all the time even with the very latest software, and is excruciatingly slow even with the very latest software. <mark>The latest software added classifications for the ebooks so you could sort them into pseudo-folders, which is necessary given how excruciatingly slow the Nook is to scroll through its book list (get about 50 books on the list and you're in for major pain), but the clunky way they implemented this makes those of us who've gotten used to modern user interfaces frown and shake our heads.Sad to say, I really can't recommend any current eBook reader.</mark> Either they're too clumsy to use (Nook), have no books available for them (Sony), or have a proprietary eBook format that locks you into a single vendor (Kindle). I'm seriously considering buying an iPad, yes, it will only work for 9 hours or so on a battery charge, but that's true of the Nook too in real actual use and the iPad is usable for a lot of other things too. It's just disappointing that I can't get an ePaper-based reader that meets my criteria (non-proprietary ebook format, long battery life, compact, decent user interface), and instead have things either crippled by bad design decisions or crippled by having a proprietary ebook format that locks you into a single vendor. Well, I don't like crippled, so I'll look elsewhere, thank you very much...</div>

      <div class="reviewTime">11 22, 2005</div>
      <div class="reviewText">This remote is a handy tool to have.  It's very basic use is as a shutter release.  It's best to use a shutter release for when your camera in on a tripod in low light situations.  Using the shutter release in this way helps to limit camera shake which improves your images.Other programmable features include a self timer, interval timer, long exposure, and exposure count.  You are permitted to use any combination all or none of these settings making the possibilities virtually limitless.I have used to self timer so that I could both take the picture, and be in it.  <mark>The self timer can be set for just shy of 100 hours if you wanted to.For time lapse, a combination of the interval timer which can be set for just shy of 100 hours and the exposure count which can be set for up to 99 shots should be set.</mark>  The self timer can be used to delay the first shot if desired.The long exposure can also be set up to just shy of 100 hours.The settings can be entered at any time without worry of inadvertent alterations.  Pressing the light button until the hold indicator is displayed will deactivate all but the light button or prevents the stop/start button from being deactivated once an operation has been started.The TC-80N3 is operated by oneCR2032 battery.  I've had my remote for over 2 years and the battery is still going strong.  I'm not sure how long the battery is supposed to last, but there is an indicator in the display panel to let me know when the battery starts to get low. If the battery is fine, I don't see the indicator at all.There is a storage place on the back for your cameras RC socket cover if you have one.  I use this with a Canon 20D so it is of no use to me.  The plug connects to the camera simply by pressing the plug into the socket.  To disconnect, pinch the plug on the side and pull out.For me, this item is a must have.  I enjoy low light photography and I get plenty of use just for this reason.  It's great to have the option available for other photographic opportunities.  It is clear to me that this is a well thought out, quality product by Canon.PROS:Acts as a simple shutter releaseProgrammable options include a self timer, interval timer, long exposure, and exposure countCONS:Cable only about 34 inches</div>
      <div class="question">It seems to shoot only a maximum of 99 exposures before having to be reset?..want to shoot time lapse over 1 hour with 1 exp every 5 sec = 720 frames</div>
      <div class="answer">If you want to go for more than 99 shots, set the exposure counter to ZERO, then it'll shoot for all eternity or until your memory card is full, whichever comes first. By setting it to zero, I shot 520 frames doing a cloud time lapse before the card said full and stopped working. If you're going beyond the max 99, you can get your feedback of how many shot by your camera's display showing how many more shots you have to go before you card is full. Then a quick change of memory card and let 'er rip some more.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">I just received and installed this alarm.  I like how easy it was to install, and it is very loud!  However, after testing it many times I was a little annoyed to find that the sensor will not pick you up until you are level with it.  <mark>We put it halfway up our stairs so that we could hear it in our room when we are sleeping, but with the 10 second delay, a potential robber/criminal could be in our room by the time the alarm finally sounds.</mark>  I was hoping it would sense as soon as the doorknob started moving since that is within 20 feet of the sensor.  Oh well, you get what you pay for.</div>
      <div class="question">Is there a delay before the alarm sounds, so one could punch in the code before being deafened?</div>
      <div class="answer">Yes, definitely. I can't remember the exact amount of time it gives you, but I was able to come in the door and put down the groceries in my arms before walking over to disarm it.</div>

Unfortunately, the DCR-TRV140 can't play Hi8 and 8mm footage, as its bigger brothers up the line, like the DCR-TRV240, can. However, it is Sony's least-expensive digital camcorder, and is quite a steal for those who want to make the digital plunge.To start off, Sony put in a 20x optical zoom and paired it with SteadyShot image stabilization. Image stabilization is a handy technology that helps to eliminate the shakiness associated with high zoom levels. The only way to avoid shakiness completely is to utilize a tripod, table, or other stable surface. The 2.5-inch LCD is the best way to frame your shots, although you can use the black-and-white EVF to preserve battery life.In addition to the normal slew of ports (IEEE 1394, S-video, mini-AV) that have made their way onto the TRV140, there's also a USB port, which, with some included software, offers some interesting functions. Specifically, it allows you to use the camcorder to capture stills, or "broadcast live video with audio," according to Sony, which seems to indicate you can use the TRV140 as a Webcam.The DCR-TRV140 comes with a power adapter, InfoLithium battery, remote control, two AA batteries, A/V cable, lens cap, shoulder strap, USB cable, and software CD-ROM.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B0000634T4-AXNBG8GI2KOQC')" id="toggleBtn-B0000634T4-AXNBG8GI2KOQC">Show more</button>

        <span class="summary">Perhaps the best choice in digital camcorders.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">08 11, 2002</div>
      <div class="reviewText">I think the first question when buying a Sony digital camcorder is, Mini DV or Digital 8. Both Mini DV casettes  and cameras are smaller but more expensive. The price is about 1.5 fold for about the same specifications. As they use the same recording system there isn't a real difference in picture quality and  data transfer. Digital8 camcorder's recording pattern allows digital recording on 8mm or Hi8 tapes but only TRV 140 can't playback ! In fact the most important difference between them the size and the weight of the camera because of the size of the casette. TRV 140 is the cheapest D8 camera. Its most important spesification is x20 optical zoom. 560 digital zoom is useless as the quality destroys completely after x40 digital zoom. LCD monitor is perfect. TRV 140 has the USB connection but you can't transfer quality videos to your PC with it. <mark>I think you need to use the  i.LINK  DV Interface (IEEE1394) on TRV 140 if you want to transfer quality videos to your PC.</mark> Of course you have the A/V out which can be used by a TV card but the quality differs. USB connection brings the ability to use your camera as a webcam and transfer still images to your PC but nothing else. Built-in light is effective only 2 meters so you need extra light in larger places. Built-in infrared light system  lets you capture video from a up to 3meters away, even in total darkness but the sceene is black and white and qualility is poor for moving objects. You can see the others on the LCD even when you can't see your own hand because of the darkness(!). It is posible to use an external infrared light system. TRV 140 records high-quality 12-bit or 16-bit digital stereo audio but it is a bit more noisy at 16 bit. When you watch your video on TV picture quality is realy wonderful. You can connect  your camcorder to a TV by A/V out, scart connector or S video cable. S video connection doesn't transfer audio and it doesn't bring an extra quality. The cable isn't included in the package and no need to pay an extra in my opinion. TRV 140 has a DV out connector but not a A/V in. Some digital camcorders can capture MPEG digital video and store it directly to the memory stick but TRV 140 can not. Movie length ranges allowed by the capacity of the memory stick and it is only some seconds. MPEG movie function can be usefull to share via the internet and you can get performance by using USB connection but nothing else. You have to pay minimum 150- 200 $ more to have a camcorder which can produce MPEG movies. There is also the photo function in TRV 140 but the quality is not like a digital camera. Photos are like paused images in good quality. In fact camcorders can not take quality photos as a  megapixel digital camera. Transfering the photos to a PC is also not practical as a digital camera too. Battery life is realy satisfactory. You can record a 60 minute casette even the LCD monitor and sometimes the built-in light is on. The remaining battery and casette is always displayed. Steady shot picture stabilization of Sony with motion sensors  works very well. As a result TRV 140 is the cheapest digital camcorder and there is not any reason for not to buy it. All digital8 camcorders are bigger and heavier than Mini DV camcorder but there is not a big difference in picture quality. Don't even think of buying a Hi8 camcorder instead of TRV 140. You will see that digital videos and sounds are very different than analogs. Perhaps TRV 140 is the best choice if you don't want to spend too much on a digital camcorder. Be sure that it is not poor of some technology as it is cheap !!</div>

      <div class="reviewText">The cable works great, and it's easy to install the software. The disc will take you to a webpage to download the software, and if you have Windows 7, when you get to that page, click the main website and navigate back to the download page to make sure it has you downloading the Windows 7 version. The disc sent me to the Windows XP version and it wouldn't install until I went and got the correct file. Once I did, it installed easily and quickly. <mark>Now, I just plug up my calculator, and drag a program onto the connect icon, and it does everything for me.By the way, I have Windows 7 64 Bit, so it will work with both 64bit and 32 bit.</mark></div>
      <div class="question">Does this product work with Windows 7 and 8 64-bit? What chipset Manufacturer is used in the USB adapter Prolific, Silicon Labs or FDTI&gt;</div>
      <div class="answer">it depends on which calculator you are trying to connect. from comments, the common TI calculators seem to work just fine. I know with my TI 86 i had to make a WinXP virtual machine because the TI connect software (wich ran fine on win8) wouldn't let me edit TI86 programs and the TI graphlink software for TI 86 wouldn't run on win8. if you are not using an obscure/discontinued calculator, you should be fine</div>

Create an instant wireless network on the go. Extend the range of your current wireless network.Featuring AirTunes for playing your iTunes music wirelessly on your home stereo   or powered speakers, AirPort Express brings not only the Internet but your music   to wherever in your home you like to enjoy them most -- whether you use a Mac   or Windows PC. Unmatched in its ease of use, it delivers data rates up to 54   megabits per second, fits in the palm of your hand so you can take it wherever   you go.Driving         the Wi-Fi RevolutionIn 1999, Apple sparked the wireless revolution with the introduction of         AirPort, the first affordable and easy-to-use solution for accessing the         Internet without restrictive cables. In 2003, AirPort Extreme took your         unwired connection to the next level by harnessing the superfast 802.11g         wireless standard for data rates nearly five times those of the 802.11b         standard that the original AirPort used and many current wireless networking         devices still use. With AirPort Express, Apple continues to advance wireless,         delivering the first device to pack wireless networking, audio, printing         and bridging capabilities into a single affordable, portable unit.AirTunes Unleashes Your MusicAirPort Express with AirTunes brings your iTunes music in your Mac or         PC into your living room -- or wherever in your home you have a stereo         or a set of powered speakers. All you have to do is connect your sound         system to the audio port on the AirPort Express Base Station using an         audio cable (included in the optional AirPort Express Stereo Connection         Kit) and AirTunes lets you play your iTunes music through your stereo         or powered speakers -- wirelessly. iTunes automatically detects the connection         of your remote speakers, so you just have to select them in the popup         list that appears at the bottom of the iTunes window and click play.Enjoy your playlists, set iTunes to shuffle through your entire library       or repeat your favorite songs over and overEnjoy your playlists, set iTunes to shuffle through your entire library or   repeat your favorite songs over and over again -- however you like to enjoy   your music on iTunes, you can now enjoy it that way through your stereo speakers,   wherever they're located in your house.Enjoy your iTunes music library in virtually any         room of your houseBuy more than one AirPort Express         Base Station and connect one to every stereo or set of powered speakers         in your house -- one to your stereo in your living room and another to         a pair of powered speakers in your kitchen, for example. Its small size         and affordability make it perfect for having more than one. Imagine being         able to play your iTunes music on whichever speakers in your house you         prefer.Because AirPort Express is so compact, you can also easily take it along         with your laptop to a friend's house and share your unique musical taste         on your friend's stereo.Add Music to Your Current Wireless NetworkIf you already have a wireless network in place, you can use AirPort Express   to add music to its capabilities. Let's say, for example, you have AirPort Extreme   set up in your den. There's no need to scrap this setup and create a whole new   one with an AirPort Express Base Station, your DSL or cable modem, printer and   stereo all in one place. Simply connect AirPort Express to your stereo in your   favorite music room and plug it into an electrical outlet -- it wirelessly links   to your existing network, letting you play your music in your room of choice   without moving anything or connecting anything else.Easy SetupListen wirelessly, connect wirelessly, extend your network wirelessly, print       wirelessly &#8212; no matter what you want to do with AirPort Express or       whether you use a Mac or PC, you can bet it&#8217;s a breeze to set up.With the AirPort Express Assistant, it&#8217;s just a matter of a few         clicks. The software automatically detects what you have connected to         AirPort Express &#8212; whether it&#8217;s your stereo, DSL or cable modem         or printer &#8212; then walks you through the easy steps to complete the         setup.Connect WirelesslyAirPort Express uses the 802.11g wireless standard to deliver blazing         data rates -- up to 54 Mbps. It supports both Macs equipped with an AirPort         Extreme Card and Wi-Fi-compliant 802.11g Windows PCs, as well as Macs         with the older AirPort Card and 802.11b Windows PCs. Everyone in your         family can surf the web wire-free because AirPort Express provides simultaneous         wireless Internet access via your DSL or cable modem for up to 10 computers.Extremely portable, AirPort Express weighs less         than seven ounces and fits in the palm of your handAirPort Express connects you         and everyone in your family not only to the Internet but to each other.         Since it employs the powerful 802.11g standard, you can wirelessly share         photos, movies and other files without having to worry about slow data         transmissions. Nor do you have to concern yourself over a difficult network         setup procedure. AirPort Express uses the revolutionary Rendezvous technology         in Mac OS X to allow your AirPort-equipped Macs running Mac OS X to detect         each other with no effort on your part -- they discover each other just         by virtue of being within the range of the network.Extend Your NetworkIf you already have a wireless network in your home and would like to         extend its range, AirPort Express is your answer. Suppose you want to         connect to the Internet with your PowerBook in an area that lies beyond         the 150-foot range of your AirPort Express or AirPort Extreme Base Station.         You can use AirPort Express as a wireless bridge to extend the range of         your primary base station.There's no need for extra wires or cables -- serving as a bridge, AirPort Express   doesn't have to be physically connected to your primary base station or to your   DSL or cable modem. Simply place AirPort Express within the range of your primary   base station and near the area where you'd like to enjoy your wireless connection.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B0002GDIII-A20S4G1EXF2OM7')" id="toggleBtn-B0002GDIII-A20S4G1EXF2OM7">Show more</button>

Load the application on your PC or Mac and follow the simple instructions and you're up and running. After purchasing and configuring a couple of leading brands of Wireless Network Print Servers I was constantly plagued with unreliability in my ability to access an HP printer. I read up on the AirPort Express and they listed print serving as a function it could perform so I took a chance and purchased one. I hooked it up in about 10 minutes and it has stayed up without any rework for over six months. <mark>I would also recommend using it in conjunction with Rendezvous (free download from Apple) for Macs or Bonjour (free from Apple again)  for PC's to automatically identify your network printers and select the one you want to print to.</mark> I like it a lot.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">I bought these to carry with us in our travel trailer because they were inexpensive and from a manufacturer with a name I knew.  My wife and I love them!  They were easy to set up and the instructions clearly tell how to use the diopter to get perfect vision, even though I wear prescription glasses and one eye is slightly weaker than the other.  We especially like the quick focus feature where you use a simple toggle lever adjustment in lieue of a dial in the center or the binoculars to focus the scene.  <mark>They have a nice carrying case to protect them from scratches too.I would definitely recommend them to a friend and we might even get a second pair for the travel trailer.</mark></div>

Sony's SLV-D300P handles just about any conceivable media format, from VHS and S-VHS tapes (which it renders at standard VHS resolution) to DVD-Video, DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, DVD+RW, MP3 CD, and JPEG picture CD. From your library of VHS videos to digital music files and digital photos, the SLV-D300P lets you enjoy them all in the comfort of a living room or bedroom.Whether your living room is currently home to an HDTV or you're merely thinking of "someday," the SLV-D300P can deliver the full potential of DVDs. Progressive scanning, referred to as 480p for the number of horizontal lines that compose the video image, creates a picture using twice the scan lines of a conventional DVD picture, providing higher resolution and sharper images while eliminating nearly all motion artifacts. Other DVD functions include bookmarking, one-disc resume play (which picks up where you left off after stopping), picture zoom, parental lock, and a screen saver.The VCR section offers one-month, eight-event advance programming to commercial skip. Your camcorder or gaming console plugs right into the front panel for hassle-free connections. Its four-head design ensures smooth slow-motion play (forward and reverse) and clear still-frame images, and with hi-fi sound the unit records and plays back stereo audio tracks. Its 19-micron heads deliver the clearest possible picture when recording or viewing in EP (extended-play) mode.The VCR automatically marks the tape with an index signal at the point where each recording begins so you can easily scan back to the start of a recording using these signals as a reference. Commercial skip makes it easier than ever to zip past commercials and unwanted "coming attractions."Connections with combo units are often inconvenient, forcing you to use separate video hookups for each section (DVD, VCR), a problem for some TVs. This player has it figured out: a single RF or composite-video connection to a television will display either the DVD or the VCR signal, depending on which format you're viewing. If you want to view DVDs in S-video or in component-video (either interlaced or progressive-scan), you will need to use two inputs, as the device will not upconvert the signal from the VCR to either of those higher-resolution formats.It's a different deal for audio: you can listen through a single set of stereo analog-audio cables for each component (one is supplied), or--if you want to enjoy DVDs in discrete 5.1-channel surround sound--you can send the DVD's audio to a compatibleaudio/video receiverand a multichannelspeaker systemthrough a digital-audio interconnect (either optical or coaxial, not supplied). The unit also comes with an RF cable that will transmit VHS audio and video to your TV, a multi-lingual onscreen display (English, Spanish, French), and a multi-brand TV/DVD/VCR remote control.What's in the BoxDVD/VCR combo, remote control, remote batteries (two AA), user's manual, stereo analog audio interconnect/composite-video cable, coaxial video cable, and warranty information.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B00008SJX3-A38ON1MOZNBCGE')" id="toggleBtn-B00008SJX3-A38ON1MOZNBCGE">Show more</button>

      <div class="reviewText">UPDATE: As of Summer 2006, this deck is gone. Stopped playing discs at all even after a lens cleaning. I threw it away and am left with a sour feeling toward anything Sony.As a DVD player it plays great. As a VCR player it also plays great, and plays videos better than two other VCRs I owned. Worn tapes play almost as new on this Sony, and I have been very pleased with the overall performance. I also like the nice touch of the machine automatically switching to the front inputs when you plug something in (in my case a camcorder).BUT: The remote is absolutely awful, and the deck doesn't automatically set itself to play on the TV.The remote is awful becuase the button groupings are not intuitive, the buttons are small, the labels are small, and they are not lit. So it is impossible to use in the dark. Further, unless you own a Sony TV, you can only use limited buttons to control the TV (no direct channel change buttons, for example, only channel up, channel down and volume).The deck doesn't set itself to play through when you switch it on as did every other VCR I have ever owned, and there is no way to do it from the front panel.  Additionally, you cannot control the DVD without the remote (OK, play only but no start menus)... <mark>So if you want to watch a DVD without the remote ... you can't.Simple things that SHOULD have been done in the original design.</mark> Typical Sony, I suppose. But they should have done better.</div>

      <div class="answer">Yes you can play both VHS tapes and DVDs on the Sony SLV-D300P.</div>

      <div class="reviewText"><mark>So this is a great starter lens, it came with my canon body when I got my camera, and I've used it tons.</mark>  It is light, smooth, fast to focus, and cheap.  My only problem was the number of times I found myself stepping back because the 35mm end of the zoom wasn't wide enough.  I now carry a 22-55 instead and love that lens (come on Amazon - get it in stock).  If you're on a budget then this lens is great.  If you can afford the little extra go for the 28-80 instead.</div>
      <div class="question">Will this lense work with a canon eos elan iie camera?</div>
      <div class="answer">Dear Mr. South: I have purchased a 35-80 mm canon lens and it works fine on my digital SRL rebel t3 camera. But it is a digital camera and it was made around 2007 or 8. I don't know if this lens will work with the elan eos which is pre-digital. I think Canon moved from EF to an EFS style lens mount. There is an article on this at wikipedia. I hope this is some help to you. Sorry, I did not have a predigital canon, only a pentax so I don't know about compatibility on that platform. This might be a very good question for a guest on quora which is a knowledge question and answer platform on the web. Sorry I hope that answer was of some help to you. Otherwise the lens functions fine.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">I've had these speakers for 5 years now, so I can tell you guys my experiences with these speakers over the years.For computer speakers that I bought for ~$120 5 years ago, they're pretty good but not fantastic. As with any 2.1 system with a separate subwoofer, it's hard to get good midrange reproduction. To my ears, these speakers have a much more balanced sound signature than the Logitech Z-2300, which I was also contemplating buying at the time. I'm glad I went with the Klipsch. While the midrange isn't recessed, it could be better. I think that in part, it's because the bass is so strong. Setting the subwoofer at the recommended white dot on the controller pod definitely provides too much bass. This is in comparison with headphones (Sennheiser HD-650/ HiFiMan RE0). Rather, I find that turning the subwoofer down all the way and then turning it clockwise 20 degrees (a tiny fraction of a turn) provides a more balanced sound signature.This is what I dislike about the system:1) The power button is behind the subwoofer. Any time I want to turn it off or on, I have to bend down, turn the subwoofer, and locate the switch.2) The LED light on the controller pod is fairly bright at night. It's not blinding, but it will be distracting if you're trying to sleep with the speakers still turned on in pitch darkness.3) The wires are very cheap and flimsy/thin.4) The DIN plug goes into the back of the subwoofer and is *very easily* damaged. I wish I had known this 5 years ago. I pushed the subwoofer (wires side) against the wall. Gradually I started getting channel imbalance. It turns out that the DIN plug metal was damaged/bent. Ordering a replacement involves replacing the entire controller pod (which slides out from under the satellite speaker). It was $23 at the time. Now, I've been very careful not to place any stress or strain on the DIN plug.5) The rubber feet on the satellites do not stay put very well. Even if you stick them on very thoroughly, they will fall off or move around, and the adhesive will remain on the satellite feet.What they do well:1) They provide an amazing amount of volume without much distortion. They will definitely annoy your neighbors if you turn it up, and the bass will travel through walls (turning down the bass will keep sensitive neighbors at bay).2) They're great for watching movies. <mark>When I watch 1080p movies on my 23 inch LCD using these speakers, it feels like I'm in a movie theater.3) At the time, they were the best 2.1 computer speakers available.4) Before I discovered audiophile-grade headphones, I was really satisfied with the increased amount of detail that I could hear from these speakers in comparison to laptop speakers.If you want the most amount of bass in your room, I would position the subwoofer speaker against a hard surface to allow the bass to propagate better.</mark> Under a desk or something works pretty well. Note that if you turn up the volume to the max, you will eventually break your speakers, so don't turn up the volume too high. I've read reports of people blowing out their subwoofer because they turned the volume up too high.That said, now, if I could do things differently, I would probably have gone with monitors, like the Audioengine A5 or the M-Audio Studiophile AV 40, for they provide much more accurate music reproduction. The Klipsch Promedia 2.1 system is no slouch though!I have thoroughly enjoyed these speakers for the past 5 years, and I don't play music at house-party volumes, so they still work very well for me. 4/5 stars!</div>
      <div class="question">im in college, how is the bass i want something that kicks and maybe even shakes the desk how do these compare to the logitech z623</div>
      <div class="answer">This will do it. These speakers have bass to spare. The sound quality is fantastic across the spectrum.</div>

        <p>The Olympus Evolt E-300 is a 100% digital SLR camera that eliminates any photographic limitations. A<span id="dots-B00061UHDS-A2Z8WNTXFB228H">...</span><span id="more-B00061UHDS-A2Z8WNTXFB228H" style="display:none"> powerful 8-megapixel CCD combines with interchangeable Zuiko digital lenses, our exclusive Supersonic Wave Filter, and other cutting-edge technologies to make for world-class images. Advances in design make for a durable and portable compact camera you can take and trust anywhere. It features impressively fast shooting and operating speeds that ensure you never miss a photo op, and the ability to switch lenses and add flashes so you never miss a beat.Image QualityAlong with the advantages provided by the 8-megapixel Full Frame Transfer CCD and Olympus's exclusive dust-eliminating Supersonic Wave Filter, images captured with the Evolt E-300 benefit from a number of additional technologies as well.The included Zuiko 14-45mm f3.5-5.6 digital SLR lens (equivalent to 28-90mm in 35mm photography)  is perfectly matched with the 4/3-type image sensor to deliver light more directly to each of the imager's pixels. Its 3.2x zoom covers a broad range, with close-ups coming out crisp and clear as near as 15 inches/38 cm. A new multicoating minimizes ghosting and flaring, while the sturdy metal lens mount ensures rugged durability. Features 12 elements in 10 groups and a weight of just 9.98 ounces/285 grams.Furthermore, the camera's TruePic TURBO image processor offers significantly improved image quality and combines with anti-blooming technology on each pixel to eliminate undesirable artifacts, moir&#xE9; patterns, and other aberrations that can appear.Dust FreeDust has long been an issue in digital photography. The Evolt E-300 features Olympus's exclusive Supersonic Wave Filter that dramatically reduces dust and other particles that settle on the image sensor. Located between the shutter and the CCD, the Supersonic Wave Filter uses high-speed ultrasonic vibration to cause dust and other microelements to fall off and be collected and held so they don't affect photographs. This filter vibrates at 350,000 times per second and is automatically activated upon powering up the camera (or manually via the menu) to render dust harmless. This unique technology provides both the freedom and comfort to shoot and interchange lenses with the confidence that your images won't be damaged or ruined by dust ever again.Built-In Pop-Up FlashThis new flash design allows close-up flash photography without the typical "lens shadow." The flash housing pops up and then forward to better illuminate subjects when using a wide-angle lens at close shooting distances.High SpeedDon't you hate shutter lag? Put an end to annoying waiting times with the high-speed performance of the Evolt E-300. Because it's equipped with our TruePic TURBO image processor, the Evolt E-300 is able to deliver fast image data processing for the files generated by this powerful digital camera. TruePic TURBO also has a huge impact on overall camera responsiveness as it accelerates the camera's startup time, decreases the shutter release lag time so you can capture images more rapidly, and provides quicker image playback for instant gratification. The Evolt E-300 also lets you capture fast-paced action with a quick 2.5-frames-per-second burst mode, and keeps you shooting fast for longer periods of time with its 64 MB image memory buffer and separate working memory for camera controls.Scene Program ModesEver wonder how to achieve the results you want without complicated and time-consuming camera settings? The Evolt E-300 lets you choose among 14 shooting options so you can concentrate on your composition and leave the settings to us.DurabilityYou can't achieve high performance without a highly durable camera. The Evolt E-300 is built to keep you and your images at an optimum level no matter where or when you use it, due to its sturdy and reliable design. An aluminum top cover provides added protection for the camera while giving it a sophisticated feel. The die-cast aluminum chassis provides a strong foundation for a camera that can be used in all kinds of conditions. The metallic lens mount is further evidence of the camera's ruggedness while also supporting the use of interchangeable lenses, up to the largest telephotos in the E-System family. It boasts a durable shutter. And its exclusive Supersonic Wave Filter repels dust and debris from the Evolt E-300&#x92;s 8-megapixel CCD so each and every image you capture is crystal clear and aberration free, just as you saw it through the lens.SizeUtilizing new concepts and new technologies, the Evolt E-300 boasts a radical new body design that makes it incredibly comfortable to hold and impressively appealing to use. Most digital SLR designs are based on traditional 35mm camera models. But innovations in digital photography have enabled us to provide an innovative design that stands out from the rest. Eliminating the bulky pentaprism commonly found on top of traditional SLRs, the Evolt E-300 incorporates a new and exclusive Olympus TTL Optical Porro Finder coupled with an exclusive side swing mirror that enables the unique flat-top appearance to be realized and increased portability to be attained.What's in the BoxEvolt E-300 body14-45mm f3.5-5.6 lensUSB cableVideo cableLithium-ion battery pack (BLM-1)Lithium-ion battery charger (BCM-2)Audio/video cableShoulder strapOlympus Master Editing softwareCD-ROMManualsWarranty cardSystem chart</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B00061UHDS-A2Z8WNTXFB228H')" id="toggleBtn-B00061UHDS-A2Z8WNTXFB228H">Show more</button>

      <div class="reviewText">Hey guess who!? The sinister minister with yet another Digicam review!Well the E300 brings my camera count up to 5 and it may very well decrease it. I have by nature been very weary of the digital SLR's even though I sell tons of them every week, I have used the Canon XT and 20D, and the Nikon D70, consistantly. I have demonstrated them untill I can set one up in my sleep, and as fast and advanced as they may seem I just couldn't get past thier hefty price tags.But then here comes the E300, the first thing you notice about this camera is it looks like no other SLR on the market, it almost like a stealth camera! Size wise it compares pretty evenly with its counterparts, however it is somewhat lighter. Unlike the Rebel XT however this camera is built like a tank, with a good solid hand grip, and a textured metal body. That aside the main thing that attracted me to this camera was the fact that it uses Digital Zuiko lenses, each lens has its own processor! How cool is that! Not to mention the benefits you get when reading light or getting in focus. And to top that off they are sanely priced!! Now the most important feature of any camera my friends is what you buy it for, and that is pictures! The E-300 takes amazing pictures! It takes them fast, clear, and in just about any light situation you can think of. Oh and by the way? thats before you even start to mess around with the settings! Lets talk about a few: ISO: Neat feature the E300 has is a thing called "ISO Boost" you can switch the 2 highest ISO settings on or off (800 & 1600)! Noise in this department was pretty darn good until you shoot at 1600 then it gets a bit spooky, there aren't many cameras that don't (believe me) even the 20D you fantasize about takes a crappy shot with the ISO cranked up! <mark>Shutter speeds are about even with most other SLRs, and it even has an 8 minute "Bulb" mode (Hooray) but you have to hold the shutter button down (BOO).Menues: This camera has the coolest, and easiest to use damn menu system I have ever seen!</mark> I love it I was running thru things like I had owned the camera for years after just a few minutes, Nothing like the Canons (some things on those I still can't find!!) 8MP: my favorite resolution! I own 4 8MP cameras and I love every one of them! I well tell you now what I tell all my customers at Bestbuy anything over 8MP is a waste of money and time, I think even 8MP is more than most people need.5MP is average 6 is just stupid, 7MP is a good point and shoot. But SLRs need to be at least 8MP (hello Nikon?) The lens ranges work so well with that resolution anything less is really an injustice (I think).Scene Modes: Yes the E-300 has a ton of them (see spec's above) including the "Sunset Mode" (I love Nikon's)This is almost as good although a little too red at times. I haven't had the camera long so I haven't had the chance to run thru them all, but the ones I have used have all been right on the money. Speed: well okay this one has to go to the 20D, speed wise the E-300 is about par, but it's not gonna win any races about 4 frames at 2.5 sec for as long as the shutter is pressed.White balance features are excellent in this camera ranging from auto to 3000k all the way up to 7500k in addition to 4 spaces for custom settings (nice job Olympus).Full AF or manual focus modes as well as several combinations of the two! Flash: the E-300 probably has the best on board flash of any camera I have ever used, and without a doubt the most versitile as far as being able to control intensity, speed, etc. I actually like using it (Normally I hate flash photography). Huge selection of Image formats: this camera will save your pictures in at least 20 different files types and resolutions, not to mention you can completely edit Raw image files directly within the camera! Exsposure, contrast, sharpness the whole deal right on board. Battery life is excellent being as good as my F-828 at 230-220 minutes.Micro-drive capable, and I absolutely love the Zuiko lenses.I have to admit I never thought I would own an Olympus let alone one of thier SLRs, Olympus has a tendency to cut on quality when it comes to thier lower end models the people that own em love em. However I have always heard that Olympus high end cameras are among the best. After using the E-300 I would agree WOW!.This camera has so many other benifits and features that I can't go into here, so check your online review sources and make up your own mind. As I said I am a professional photographer and I sell cameras and aside from some bells and whistles, speed you'll never use, the E-300 is everybit as good a digital SLR camera as its Canon and Nikon counterparts (more so in some ways)The biggest being price!I added another lens to mine and a Microdrive (4gb) and a Canon would have still cost me more, and I'd still be lost in those menus!Want my advice? Put the E-300 on your short list and decide based on picture and price, not speed. Weather its film or digital, photography has always been about the pictures, SLR's by nature take amazing photographs, is it really worth it to have to take on a second job just to pay for it!? I hope this helps somewhat, after I have used the camera a while I may offer an update, until then Happy shooting!</div>
      <div class="question">How is the shutter speed/lag time?</div>
      <div class="answer">It's not to bad, but I do wish it was faster. My Nikon 35mm has a faster shutter speed but, I have to wait for the film to develope for that.</div>

        <p>If you're used to a traditional mouse, then the Logitech TrackMan Marble FX may take a little gettin<span id="dots-B00000JBUI-A224QFTS1NPBMH">...</span><span id="more-B00000JBUI-A224QFTS1NPBMH" style="display:none">g used to. But despite its large, clunky appearance, this mouse has it all. Designed for those with limited desktop space, the TrackMan Marble FX remains stationary. You operate it by moving a large marble with your fingers while a sensor inside the mouse interprets the movement.Solid and well built, the TrackMan Marble FX has a large, eye-catching red marble. Its weight and rubberized bottom keep it from sliding on your desk, and the curve of the mouse fits most hands (except lefties). Those with small hands may find it hard to reach the left-click mouse button, making double-clicking tricky.Installation is not as quick as most plug-and-play mouse devices, as you must install Logitech MouseWare software to fully take advantage of the TrackMan Marble FX's features. However, the manual walks you through installation, making set up easy and quick.Perhaps the nicest feature of this trackball is the four programmable buttons. During setup, you can program which buttons you want to perform certain functions. Most will want to set the far left and right buttons as on a typical PC mouse. However, the two middle buttons can be set for functions such as universal scroll, auto scroll, zoom, drag lock, or HyperJump and CyberJump--pop-up windows with shortcut functions in Windows 95 and Internet environments.If you're in the market for a trackball and have the time to learn to use a new type of mouse, then you'll want to consider the TrackMan Marble FX. Its durability and low maintenance make it superior and easy to use.Pros:Sturdy and well constructedProgrammable buttonsDirt resistantCons:Difficult for those with small handsNot designed for leftiesRequires software installation</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B00000JBUI-A224QFTS1NPBMH')" id="toggleBtn-B00000JBUI-A224QFTS1NPBMH">Show more</button>

      <div class="reviewText">I was aprehensive a first but now I'll never go back to a mouse.  Four assignable buttons make this a dream to use, especially when surffing the web.  <mark>And those of you addicted to the scroll wheel will love the ability  to not only scroll up and down but left and right using the ball.</mark>  Using  this product has actually reduced the effects of carple tunnel syndrome for  me.  Because I can put my wrist at an angle (wrist straight but rotated  about 20 degrees clockwise) it feels more natural and reduces twist at the  elbow.  Also, since you don't have to move it, it uses less desk space.  I  don't like using it when playing fast paced shooting games.  The track ball  motion isn't a natural movement when pointing in a hurry.  I would also  like to see a left handed model.</div>

        <p>The EasyShare printer dock is, in a word, awesome. Despite a few minor flaws, it essentially  solves<span id="dots-B0001G6U7K-A165OWIWJVVYRR">...</span><span id="more-B0001G6U7K-A165OWIWJVVYRR" style="display:none"> the basic problem of digital photography, namely that we all have hard drives crammed with thousands of images and no actual physical photos (you remember, the kind you can put on your refrigerator and mail to your mom). And it solves this problemaffordably, at about 29 cents a print once you factor in the cost of paper and cartridges. But most important of all, the quality of the photos it prints is eye-wateringly good.Kodak Xtralife coating makes prints waterproof and durable under typical home use.The EasyShare printer is a snap to set up, even for dedicated technophobes like myself. You simply snap the pieces into place, dock your compatible Kodak camera, and press thePrintbutton. Printing itself takes about 60 seconds. The 4 x 6-inch photo paper passes back and forth through the printer four times, allowing you to witness the application of each primary color and a final, invisible protective coating. Does it really deliver archival quality, as claimed? There's no way to know for sure until a few decades have passed, but the colors at leastlooksturdily vibrant and crisp. The print quality is in fact much higher than what I have come to expect from drugstores for my film camera prints. The contours are sharp as a knife, the contrast pitch perfect. At the push of a button, the printer will produce multiple prints (two, six, or nine) on a single sheet, which is perfect for making wallet-sized snaps of the kids.Among the above-mentioned minor flaws, number one is paper jams, which happen every eighth print or so. The jams are solved easily enough by unplugging and plugging the unit back in, but are still annoying. The second problem is that printing from a PC is not nearly as smooth and easy as printing directly from a Kodak camera. Installing the included software is easy enough, but more often than not, trying to print from my hard drive was a lesson in frustration. To get around the PC quandary, you can print directly from any PictBridge-enabled digital camera or from SD or MMC cards using the built-in card slot.Quibbles aside, though, the EasyShare printer dock is essential for anyone wishing to complete the digital circle from virtual pictures to real-world photographs with glorious color and razor-sharp detail. --David StoeszProsAffordabilityOutstanding picture qualityEase of useConsFrequent paper jamsPrinting from PCs is a hassle</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B0001G6U7K-A165OWIWJVVYRR')" id="toggleBtn-B0001G6U7K-A165OWIWJVVYRR">Show more</button>

      <div class="question">will this work as a normal printer if you hook up to laptop?</div>
      <div class="answer">NO NO NO Kodak has not made anything for this printer in over 5 years. The paper and ink is out of date and will not work properly. Save your money. Regular printers are low price and wireless, just right for a laptop.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">At first I was skeptical in buying this product because I really wanted a tall and sturdy tripod. My main concern is also with the fluidity of the panning and tilting features of the tripod since I will be using a videocam with it. Anyway, I bought  it because of the good reviews it has and also of its free shipping since I'm on a Prime trial.I truly have NO REGRETS in buying this thing of beauty. <mark>It's tall enough for me and the panning and tilting features are fluid so long as you know how to properly adjust them.</mark> The tripod is also surprisingly sturdy, I think it's made of metal cause of its heaviness and built. Very easy to use and to setup too! For the price, it's really something every aspiring film maker or home video addict should get!</div>

They share the same patented microlouver technology used in 3M&trade;Frameless LCDand FramedLCD Filters, blocking the view of curious onlookers without diminishing yours. So you can enjoy peace of mind using your laptop or netbook in close quarters or high traffic areas. Plus, easy-on, easy-off 3M&trade; Privacy Filters are the convenient way to create a barrier between your fragile LCD screen and inevitable scuffs and scratches.

Even better, all 3M Privacy Filters are backed by a one-year warranty.To ensure proper fit,measure the viewable height and widthof your laptop screen. (Do not include the screen frame in your measurement.) Then, choose the filter size that matches your exact measurements, or slightly smaller.Measure Twice. Order Once.Even if you have a pretty good idea what screen size and aspect ratio your laptop or netbook boasts, it&rsquo;s best to pull out the ruler. By ordering the 3M&trade; Privacy Filter that is a perfect fit for your widescreen or standard laptop or netbook, you&rsquo;ll save time and money by avoiding the hassle of returns and exchanges. See the measuring instructions diagram to determine your perfect fit from the model list above.It's a matter of perspective.Whether it&rsquo;s staying compliant for work or keeping family photos to yourself, privacy is central to everything you do. 3M&trade; Privacy Filters create a 30-degree cone of vision so on-screen data is visible only to those directly in front of your screen.Microlouver technology exclusive to 3M&trade; Privacy Filters and Films creates an invisible 60-degree &ldquo;safe area&rdquo; where on-screen data is visible only to those directly in front of the monitor&mdash;without blurring or distorting.Fear no train commute, plane seat, park bench, cubicle farm or coffee house.

Patented 3M&trade; Advanced Light Control Film (ALCF) technology contains closely spaced black microlouvers positioned to 1-degree precision, with over a dozen louvers per millimeter evenly distributed across the screen. It&rsquo;s a mini Venetian blind with no strings attached.Microlouvers just one-fifth the width of a human hair simulate tiny Venetian blinds to shield out curious glances toward your screen while directing onscreen data to the user&rsquo;s viewing area.Easy-on, easy-off attachment system makes 3M&trade; Privacy Filters the perfect fit for laptop and netbook users on the go.Scuff happens.Today's laptop and netbook screens are brighter and easier to view. But fragile LCD surfaces are easier to scratch, scuff, smudge or damage, making it difficult to view your data. And repairs can be costly and time-consuming. 3M&trade; Privacy Filters provide your laptop or netbook extra protection against everyday use the moment you place it on your screen.

      <div class="reviewText">I recently purchased a Dell 15R SE and was looking for a privacy filter for a long overseas flight. At the time, there weren't any reviews that mentioned my computer, but based on the dimensions provided, it seemed as if it would fit. Well, it fits perfectly with no modifications required. <mark>I attached the tabs/holders in such a way that I could still slide the filter off if needed.The filter does a great job of limiting the view from the sides, but it also degrades the view from front and causes some eye strain.</mark> I intended on keeping the filter on all the time, but decided to use it only on trips and leave it off at home due to the additional eye strain it caused.If there is way to reduce the additional eye strain, I'd rate it 5 stars.</div>
      <div class="question">Is this the best product that you are aware of for reducing eye strain from laptop use?</div>
      <div class="answer">Main purpose of this privacy screen is to protect your information displayed on the screen from the person who is setting beside you. I may reduce the glare from the screen when you are seeing it directly but not sure that this is the best product that I am aware of for reducing eye strain from laptop use.</div>

      <div class="answer">depends on what you define as work it works great for my use lots of folks here dont seem happy but that may be more their misuse or wrong expectations this thing lowers the high volume by 10db it raises the low volume about 10db it compresses the entire sound into a 30db rnge nothing it can do if a commercial has already been compressed down to no dynamic range you need some look ahead agc to fix that problem downside is occasional clicking no noise with my unit no failures with my unit (yet?) for $30 it is plenty good pay $300 and buy a dbx pro model compress/limit/gate if you want more</div>

      <div class="reviewText">I'm sure Canon makes high profit margins on these batteries.  It's so tempting to buy the generics that cost 1/3 the price. But what I know from the school of hard knocks is that the generic batteries are terrible.  These Canon original batteries are really great.  I have a G7 and have taken over 9000 photos with it.  This is the second time I've had to replace the battery in 3 years.  <mark>So the battery life for my type of moderately heavy usage is about a year and a half, or about 4500 photos.</mark>  That's very good, considering the high demands of modern digital cameras on the batteries.When I first replaced the battery, the Canon battery lasted literally for months before even needing to be recharged.  It was amazing.  Then, after a few charges, each time it needed to be recharged sooner.  Finally, you can tell the battery is reaching the end of its life when it needs to be recharged in as little as 3 or 4 days of use.  Then one day, in the middle of using it - poof! it no longer works, and no longer can hold any charge at all.I've tried the generics, and they are only about $25, but they act from day one like this original battery acts after months of use.  I got no more than a month's worth of use from a generic battery.  Never again!Just my experience - but with heavy use, this Canon battery is a champ, and like the old cliche, you get what you pay for.</div>
      <div class="question">What is the length of battery life once fully charged?</div>
      <div class="answer">About 500 pictures but less if you use flash or spend a lot of time viewing your photos on the screen.</div>

Extra speakers cause the impedance (ohms) to drop, stressing the amp beyond its limits. When this situation exists damage to the circuitry, amp shutdown, and even the risk of the amp burning up and catching fire can occur. This is a high price to play for music enjoyment., however, the impedance (ohms) may drop stressing the amp beyond its limits. When this situation exists damage to the circuitry, amp shutdown, and even the risk of teh amp burning up and catching fire can occur. This is a high price to pay for music enjoyment.Using a speaker selector can avoid damaging your amp, however ordinary speaker selectors use resistors in series which limit the high frequencies so you hear less detail in the music. Additionally, they have a low power and current rating, use of a high current amp will damage the selector over time.Convenience, Performance and ProtectionMonster Speaker Selectors feature Advanced Power Protection circuitry that is made with high-quality materials for maximum reliability and durability.

The result is a powerful machine in the palm of your hand.Map page.View larger.Mark waypoint.View larger.The Garmin eTrex is a simple, compact GPS device.View larger.Besides its small size, boaters and outdoorsmen will be happy with the eTrex's unique button layout design. All the buttons are located on either side of the unit. The benefits of this design are two-fold. First, the eTrex is a breeze to operate with just one hand and, second, with the buttons on both sides of the unit the bulk of the front of the device is dedicated to the large, LCD display with backlight. The eTrex is so simple it only sports five buttons -- Page, Power, Up, Down, and Enter. Thanks to the its bright yellow case, the eTrex is easy to spot and hard to misplace in a boat, backpack, or trunk. Garmin also designed this tiny GPS to be completely waterproof so it can handle an accidental splash or dunk and continue to perform.Locked away behind the waterproof protection, you will find the proven performance of a 12 parallel channel GPS receiver that will run for up to 22 hours on just two AA batteries. The antenna is also internal and the external power and data connector are protected as well. In addition to determining your location, the eTrex creates, names, and saves a location as an electronic waypoint in its memory -- up to 500 individual waypoints. This allows you to navigate back to this point any time you want, from any location or, with Garmin's TracBack feature, you can reverse your track log and navigate your way back home. And once you start moving, the GPS provides other data, like speed, direction of movement, time and distance to destination, and more.In addition to these basic features, the eTrex provides one more critical benefit;peace of mind, because with GPS you know where you are, where you've been, and where you are going. And since you always know your way back home, you can concentrate on enjoy yourself outdoors, on the water, or wherever your travels may take you.What's in the BoxeTrex GPS receiver, wrist strap, user's guide, and quick reference guide.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B00003WGP5-A2KBHPRZ2VEXD0')" id="toggleBtn-B00003WGP5-A2KBHPRZ2VEXD0">Show more</button>

      <div class="reviewText">This basic yellow one is the cheapest one.  It is alright but I dont know if you can download maps to it or not, they might be pretty expensive to get the CD's.  Also the compass on it doesn't seem to be very accurate as many times it will not point in the right direction until you turn several times to make sure most of the time it is in the right direction.  <mark>All it really gives you is a marking of where you've been, it has good info like elevation and speed, but its not for the serious GPS user.</mark></div>

        <span class="summary">This RC1 destroys your self-portraits! Get the radio remote control instead</span>
      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">02 11, 2008</div>
      <div class="reviewText">I bought this Canon Wireless Remote Control RC1, with the Rebel XTi because I wanted to learn taking portraits and wanted to try it on myself first. But this RC1 was good for nothing, seriously! Here are the reasons that make me hate it:1. You have to be in front of the camera to use it.  That means you can not avoid to be in the picture.  And when you are in the picture, you can not hide it. You have to advertise it in front of every picture that you are in! Yes! you pay Canon to do free commercial for them.2. The Canon RC1 can not focus the camera.  Therefore, you must pre-focus the spot before you jump into it to take the shot. Yes, I really mean you have to run and jump into the spot to take the picture because the camera will switch off in ten seconds when it is in remote-control mode. In fact, the camera's self-timer mode works a lot better than this RC1.  With the self-timer, you will be in the picture without showing the ugly remote control in your hand every time.3. This RC1 is not good for self portrait shoot. Period! I got it for that only purpose.  But it destroyed nearly all of my self portrait shots.  <mark>Because it can not focus the camera, I had to put something at the spot that I would be in and focus it first.</mark>  The problem is to find the object of my size to put in my place for focusing. I like to take pictures of me in my natural environment, like sitting at my desk, cooking in the kitchen, working in the backyard, sitting and playing the guitar, etc. It is impossible to find something to take my place for focusing in many situations like that.  I need a remote control that can focus the camera on me (a live subject) and not a still object right at the exact spot that I am in.  And the Canon RC1 can not do that. I took hundreds of pictures of myself in various situations using this RC1 and only a few of them were in good focus. The worse shots were those close-up (just a few feet away from the camera) and in low light even though I used the EF 50mm f/1.2L USM lens which usually produces very clear pictures in low light.If you only occasionally want to be in the picture, then you will be more happy with the self-timer mode than this RC1.  But if you want to do a lot of self-portrait shots, then get yourself a radio wireless shutter release, instead.  There is one on Amazon. But it is very expensive.  There are plenty of good and brand new ones on e bay on sales for 20 - 30 bucks. These brand new devices are cheap because they are massively made in China. Do not try to think that Chinese products are not good. What in the world today is not made in China?I got one from Gaget Infinity on e bay for 19 bucks plus 10 bucks shipping from Hong Kong.  It took two weeks to ship from Hong Kong to California.  But it worths it.  This litte radio wireless shutter release is not as nicely built as the RC1, but it does the job that it is supposed to do.  It comes with a radio receiver, which is plugged into the camera and a radio remote control the same size as the RC1.  The remote control lets you press half-way to focus the camera, and press all the way to take the shot.  The camera does not have to be in remote mode. You can even wake up a sleeping camera by pressing the control half way.  You can not do that with the RC1.  The bad thing about the RC1 is that if you do not press it within ten seconds, the camera goes to sleep and then you must press the shutter button (half-way) on the camera (not on the RC1) to wake the camera up. Ten seconds are never really enough time for posing a good portrait shot!With the radio wireless shutter release, you can take as much time as you need to make yourself look good in front of the camera.  With it, I got my self-portraits the way I wanted and that they were perfectly in focus everytime. I used it for all kind of shots when I need to mount the camera on a tripod.  It is the best tool for controlling camera shake. It is also a good device when you want to take pictures of little children playing, birds, and little animals around your house.  You just set the camera hidden at some place and go back to your work.  When the subject enters the picture frame, just press the remote control half-way to focus, and press it all the way to snap the picture.  You snap the best picture of your subject in its natural environment without disturbing it!While the RC1's range is only several feet, the radio remote control that I got works well within 25 feet. And the nice thing about it is that it does not have to be in front of the camera and I do not have to expose it when I am in the picture.A radio remote control for the same price of this RC1 or cheaper will work fine for you.  But do not get this RC1 or any kind of infrared remote control like it!  This kind of remote control is good for TV, but not for camera!</div>
      <div class="question">auto focus? Can you auto focus with this remote controller?</div>
      <div class="answer">Yes, it will autofocus as long as the camera lens is set to auto.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">You can never hear your pitch correctly with double headphones. These headphones are perfect for recording solo instrumentalists, ensembles, solo vocalists, and backing vocal groups. <mark>There is simply too much temptation with dual headphones for the talent to slip the other ear on (listening with one ear is inherently annoying) BUT when you do that you cannot hear the right pitch you're creating.</mark> Just a fact of acoustics, you will be "headphone flat". Many vocalists in the 60's and 70's had this problem, you can hear them consistently being an eight tone flat by wearing double headphones.It's annoying to listen with one ear off, but get used to it for anything remotely approaching perfect pitch.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">I had an expensive headset for a long time, and consistently got complaints that no one could hear me very well. I had to hold the mic near my mouth, and eventually the whole thing fell apart. This headset is much cheaper and the quality is SO much better. <mark>I had to turn my volume down b/c it's almost too good!</mark> And the mic can be adjusted to sit wherever you'd like, which is such a great feature.</div>

      <div class="reviewTime">10 15, 2010</div>
      <div class="reviewText">Very nice compact binoculars. They are very lightweight and relatively small. The image is very sharp. I compared them against a number of other binoculars and these are probably the best among those with street price of less than two hundred. They are in the same class as the Nikon Travelite series, but the Pentax warranty is better, and arguably these binoculars are optically a bit better. These binoculars are ideal for tourism, travel, watching wildlife or air shows.This model also comes in an identically looking WP (waterproof) version which is slightly more expensive. In my own comparison, and others' opinions, this version is optically a tiny bit sharper than the WP version. It was a hard decision to give up waterproofing, but I decided to go with better image quality. The difference was not major, so you may want to buy the WP model instead, especially if you are going to be on boats or in humid climates.Pentax also makes similar models with higher magnification, 10x25 or even higher. They have a narrower field of view and are harder to hold steady (especially since they are so light), so you are probably better off staying with 8x25 on this one. <mark>8x25 makes it easier to scan the landscape and find what you are looking for during the day.Could these binoculars be better?</mark> Sure, they could have even sharper optics (you normally pay hundreds more to get to the next level), be smaller (these won't fit my shirt pocket), waterproof, and have a wider neck strap. However, for the price these are amazing, and definitely head-and-shoulders above the cheap no-name binoculars you find at discount stores and most sports stores. In other words, if you need a good pair, this model is a great place to start - anything less would be a visible compromise :)Highly recommended.</div>
      <div class="question">what is the size of the binoculars in inches on the outside?</div>
      <div class="answer">When the binoculars are out of the case, these are the dimensions: Length 4 3/4\" Width 5\" Depth 2\"</div>

It is a slim case that provides reasonable protection. <mark>I have the case for several weeks already and it barely shows any signs of wear.</mark> It does have a minimal lip that will protect the screen from any scratches against a desk.I also enjoy the feel of the case, since it does not feel sticky or rubbery whatsoever. It slides in and out of my pocket with no issues, but yet I can grip it without any issues of slipping out of my hand.For the money a really good investment.

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">05 19, 2012</div>
      <div class="reviewText">This quick disconnect cord was purchased to replace one that was misplaced.  <mark>We'd bought the first cord along with a Plantronics headset, and both had worked excellently for several months for my wife, who uses the phone many hours daily in a sales situation.</mark>  When the original quick disconnect cord was misplaced, we purchased the exact same model as a replacement, even paying 2nd day shipping to get back to full function quickly.What a disappointment and waste of money.  Whereby the first cord and the headset mated perfectly and worked without flaw, there have been consistent sound quality problems since starting to use this second cord.  There are no visible problems with the cord, and I eventually tried some spray contact cleaner as I connected and disconnected the quick disconnect plugs of the cord and headset to see if that would help to produce a robust connection.  The issue with poor sound quality persists.Fortunately, we found the original, misplaced version of this cord a couple of days ago, and thankfully it still works flawlessly.So... Two versions of this same cord... two distinctly different results in functionality and/or quality.  While the confort and sound quality of the Plantronics headset has been a blessing for my wife, I'm not sure we'd order this combination again due to the variations in quality with this cord.</div>
      <div class="question">Can I use this cord with my i phone and the Plantronics H81?</div>

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">03 1, 2013</div>
      <div class="reviewText">The product is well made and looks great.  I have had it installed for about a week and its working great.  Once its connected to the amp and speakers everything is fine, its just that the connectors are small and fiddly, and it is quite difficult to push speaker wires into them.  The fact that the connector blocks can be removed from the chassis seems like a good thing until you realize that the spring action of the terminals is so strong that you can't get any leverage unless the blocks are plugged into the chassis.  And not only are the terminals small but the wires are close together.  After a while I figured out that the only way wires will go in at all is on an upward trajectory because that's where the space is when you force the contact spring open.  All in all, plugging 18 gauge wire was hard, 16 more difficult.  I wouldn't want to try 14 gauge.  <mark>The box is not powered and the directions tell you to be sure to push the button to engage the protection circuit if you turn on more that two pairs of speakers.</mark>  My wife said, &#34;Just leave it on all the time.&#34;  She's right.  My amp has more than enough power to drive one or two speakers with the extra impedance and pushing the button just attenuates the volume a little.  We mostly run with all the speakers on anyway and there is plenty of volume even at - 50db.  My Yamaha HTR-5650 is just loafing driving 8 wall speakers through the Niles SS4.  I'm glad I bought it, but if they made the connectors big enough to accept banana plugs it would be a huge improvement.</div>
      <div class="question">My amplifier is capable of one pair of 4 ohms load. Can I use this to connect 2 pairs of speakers, each pair are 4 ohms load.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">Bought this to replace the strap that came with my Canon 40D. Fits real nice and gives good balance around my neck. Less discomfort especially when I have a heavier telephoto lens or flash. <mark>The strap is a little wider by the neck and therefore doesn't cut into your neck or shoulders when you are carrying your camera around all day.Great value and I would recommend that you replace your OEM strap with one like this!</mark></div>
      <div class="question">Can this strap be configured like a standard OEM neck strap (camera over your chest) as well as a sling-like configuration?</div>
      <div class="answer">Yes it can, however the width of the pad will cover the back of your neck almost completely. The main benefit of this strap is when you're carrying a lot of weight. Additionally, you can use the fastex buckles to remove the center section of the strap and fasten the two short ends together to make a short hand-carry strap for your camera. The one downside of this strap is that the loops that fasten the strap to the camera tend to twist up and have to periodically be allowed to untwist by opening the buckles.</div>

        <span class="summary">Quiet - not noisy like more-recent versions.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">04 6, 2011</div>
      <div class="reviewText">This translucent-blue square-edged old-style Iomega Zip 100 drive is quiet - it does *not* make irritating racket like some of the other, more recent, rounded-edge Iomega Zip drives. This translucent/clear-blue Iomega drive just makes a polite barely-audible tiny little whirring noise when it's accessing files, and it makes the standard 1999-era non-objectionable mild "thunk" when you eject a disk.So if you've ever owned one of the original Iomega Zip drives from back in the late 1990s, that's the same kind of nice sound that this one makes.Also, when you eject a disk from this drive, the disk doesn't go flying out of the drive like on some of the newer models - it only ejects far enough for you to reach it. Perfect.This Zip drive's case is sturdy and solid, seems well-built, not flimsy like some newer models.The quietness quality is exactly why I bought this Zip drive - to replace newer noisy ones that were waking up my neighbors (seriously). I've owned two of the noisy newer ones, and I'd had quite enough of them, so I am very happy to finally get ahold of another old-style traditional quiet Zip drive. (One of my noisy flimsy newer ones got accidently dropped onto a concrete floor and stopped working, and the other noisy newer one I will keep for a spare for future years' use, just in case.)At least in my case, the Zip drive being reviewed here, works perfectly in both Microsoft Windows XP Pro and Ubuntu 10.10 (Linux). No bugs, no glitches, just good solid performance. The PC that I have this Zip drive hooked up to, dual-boots to both Ubuntu and XP Pro, and the Zip drive works fine with both of those OS's.I use Zip drives for occasional file transfers between a fairly-modern low-end PC (for internet and coding) and an antique Mac (which is used for image editing). The ancient Mac has no USB capability, but it has its own separate SCSI Zip drive built-in, which makes it easy to use the exact same Zip *disks* on both the PC and the Mac (the Mac reads/writes to PC-formatted disks). Due to the huge difference in ages of the operating-systems I run, for me to try to do something fancy like "network" the machines would be beyond my meager technical abilities (or lack of), and the old Mac isn't suitable for online/internet use anymore, so I depend on Zip disks for an occasional (once a week or so) small file transfer between machines. I will probably still be using Zip disks for years to come, given the financial investments I have in legacy high-end software (which only runs on the old hardware). Zip disks keep me from having to spend $10,000.00 on an entirely new equivalent system+software+peripherals, and the old stuff still works just like new.Under Windows XP, for the Zip drive being reviewed here, you can optionally install the Iomega software (comes on a CD included with the Zip drive, or at least it does if you're buying one of the new factory-sealed drives - however, used/second-hand models might or might not have the CD but you can probably download the software from Iomega or someplace) or you can ignore the Iomega software - Windows XP can use the Zip drive without any extra drivers (the drivers are apparently already built into Windows somehow). Although if you want to do stuff like long format+verify of your Zip disks (good to do once a year or so, as preventative maintenance), you would have to install the Iomega software to do that, because Windows doesn't do the normal *thorough* Iomega 8-minute format+verify on Zip disks. But it does everything else just fine.Under Ubuntu 10.10, this Zip drive is also recognized and fully functional, without having to install any drivers or software, and no need for any command-line wizardry either. I haven't tried hot-swapping the Zip drive; I plugged in this Zip drive first, then booted (started) the computer, and the Zip drive is instantly recognized and ready for use. However, I don't know if there's any way to do the 8-minute long-format-and-verify of Zip disks in Ubuntu. My Zip disks are PC-formatted, but Ubuntu reads/writes to them just fine. NOTE: Seems that if your Zip disks are *Mac* formatted, Ubuntu 10.10 has permissions problems and mounts the disks as read-only - it can read the files but not modify/add/delete files - there might be some workaround for that but I'm not technically knowledgable enough (nor sufficiently motivated) to figure that out. Anyway, Ubuntu works fine with *PC-formatted* Zip disks, and since the old Mac also can read/write PC-formatted Zip disks (via, in my case, the Apple "PC Exchange" control panel (see footnote below) in Mac OS 8.1, and the Mac's own *separate* SCSI Zip drive), the Zip *disks* serve as a nice simple fuss-free way to transfer files to/from a USB-equipped modern PC and a non-USB antique Mac. If you're trying to set up something like this, don't forget that you'll need *two* Zip *drives* - a USB Zip drive (like the one I'm reviewing here on this page) for the modern computer, *and* a separate non-USB Zip drive (most likely SCSI for antique Macs, I-dunno-what for antique PCs) for the antique computer.This Zip drive being reviewed here, was manufactured during the era where I assume it is probably USB 1 or one-point-something, but it works just fine with my USB 2.x PC - USB is pretty excellent with handling "backward-compatibility" things like that. The write speed should theoretically be slower but I haven't really noticed any difference. Let's face it, these Zip disks only hold 100 MB anyway, actually more like 95 MB or so after formatting, so it's not like you're going to be putting gigantic files on 'em anyway. So the difference in speed, between USB 1 and USB 2, isn't really a noticeable issue with Zip drives.One other note:I have been a regular user of Zip drives and Zip disks since the late 1990s and, for some reason I have never experienced (knock on wood) the infamous Iomega "click of death" that some people have experienced. I don't know why. Maybe because I long-format my Zip disks at least once a year just as prevention, or maybe because they aren't in a dusty or hot environment, or maybe because they're only used between two Zip drives and not bounced around between dozens of 'em, or maybe because they only get ejected/inserted a few times a week at the most (thus not wearing out the mechanism), or maybe just luck. Although I wouldn't recommend using any single media-type as your only backup (redundancy is always good, for backups, just in case one method fails), but for my uses, Zip disks have been, are still are, a reasonably-reliable and definitely-easy file-transfer method.Of course, if *all* your computers have USB, just use USB thumb-drives instead of Zip drives. :)Oh, one other thing, in case other people haven't already mentioned this (I haven't yet read *all* the other reviews here, will do that later) - this particular Zip drive has (or at least, is *supposed* to have) its own separate power-supply that you plug into a regular A/C outlet, so the drive has its own power, rather than being USB-powered. This is probably a good thing because if you already have tons of stuff plugged into your USB ports (using multiple low-cost non-powered USB hubs), this way you don't have to worry about putting too much electrical drain on your USB ports. No need for a "powered usb hub" or anything. <mark>I happen to be running this particular USB Zip drive off of a USB hub that has other things plugged into it too, although I read someplace once that sometimes you have to plug certain things directly into a port on the computer, instead of using a hub... works good either way for me, though.____* FOOTNOTE:With regards to the Apple "PC Exchange" control panel on antique Macs, in my case there was a conflict between it and (ironically) the Mac version of Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 web-browser.</mark> The workaround, since the old Mac isn't used for internet/online stuff anymore anyway, was just to disable most of the IE-related extensions in the System Folder, and that solved the problem. Now the old Mac can read/write PC-formatted disks again, including Zip disks - on its own separate SCSI Zip drive, not the one being reviewed here, but Zip *disks* can be transferred to any Zip drive on any computer, including the Zip drive being reviewed here. This is relevant to this review because of the legacy aspects of all this equipment, including Zip disks and their usefulness for transferring files between old and new computers of different types. :)------** EDITED to reflect the fact that the Zip drive I'm reviewing here, was new factory-sealed in the original box (pretty amazing considering that I purchased it in April 2011), had not been previously used, and all the parts were there that were supposed to be there. I don't know if that matters *except* when it comes to things that (in my case) were included with this particular Zip drive, such as the power supply (REQUIRED) and the CD (optional). Trying to future-proof :) this review, if you choose to buy one of the various used/second-hand models instead of one of the new-in-original-box models (depending on what's available), you might or might not get those other items such as power-supply and CD - ask whichever seller you're buying from, if it isn't already specified on the Amazon page... these things tend to change fairly quickly.</div>
      <div class="question">Mac compatible?</div>
      <div class="answer">Yes. This worked with the iMac. I had a lot of old zip disk files from my old g3 and this open all of them.</div>

        <p>Panasonic created the AG-DVX100 with a single goal in mind: To provide the ultimate handheld recordi<span id="dots-B000075AEV-A1YHQ1JWEJK6BI">...</span><span id="more-B000075AEV-A1YHQ1JWEJK6BI" style="display:none">ng tool for video professionals. A well balanced, lightweight DV camera, the AG-DVX100 represents the crystallization of decades of advanced Panasonic video technology. It responds to today's professional broadcasting needs with a wide-angle lens and high sensitivity. It delivers the finest image quality in its class. Its manual-oriented controls are designed to satisfy professionals. And with features like the 24p/30p Cinema mode and IEEE 1394 interface, the AG-DVX100 is ready for the next generation of visual production. The AG-DVX100 packs all this performance and versatility into a conveniently small, perfectly balanced body that weighs only 4 lb (1.8 kg) in full operating condition. With the AG-DVX100, Panasonic proudly presents a video camera that excels in every aspect of news gathering, wedding, live event coverage, video production, and filmmaking. It's the ultimate handheld camera for professionals.New 410,000-Pixel, 3CCD Image SystemPanasonic designed the AG-DVX100 to deliver the highest sensitivity and picture quality in its class. At its heart is a 3CCD RGB system comprising three 1/3-inch, 410,000-pixel progressive CCDs developed especially for broadcast and professional applications. The new on-chip lens design achieves high F11 sensitivity, allowing the AG-DVX100 to record in light as dim as below three lux, for example, in nighttime news gathering. Picture quality is outstanding, with a high S/N ratio that means less noise in darker parts of the image and low smear that allows shooting in sunlight or under bright spotlights.World's First 24p Mode and Cine-Like Gamma Handheld Camera for FilmmakersThe AG-DVX100 is the world's first handheld camera designed with cinema specifications. With its superb, film-like picture quality, the AG-DVX100 stands as a revolutionary development for independent filmmakers and anyone who produces short movies or streaming video for online distribution. The AG-DVX100 gives you a choice of three shooting modes. Select 24p (24 fps, progressive) for images with a movie film-like look and motion, 30p (30 fps, progressive), or standard 60i (60 fps, interlace). Images captured in 24p mode can be 2:3 pulldown-converted (24p Mode) or 2:3:3:2 pulldown-converted (24p Advance Mode) and recorded onto tape in the standard 60i TV format. They can also be played back using an ordinary DV VTR and TV monitor and edited with a DV system.Fast, Smooth, Cam-Driven Manual ZoomThe AG-DVX100 is the first DV handheld camera to be equipped with the cam-driven manual zoom ring found on most professional cameras with interchangeable lenses. The AG-DVX100's pin configuration and tactile sensitivity replicate the familiar look and feel of a professional lens. Its lens provides quick, nimble zooming with a multi-speed servo-driven zoom plus three speed handle zoom. Select the zoom method that best suits the task at hand.Manual/Auto FocusEnjoy fast, sharp focusing either manually or automatically. In manual mode, the focus ring provides the same responsive control as conventional professional cameras with interchangeable lenses. In auto mode you get the kind of sharp, instant focusing needed in news gathering or when shooting at a high or low angle. When set to the infinity position, the focal distance is immediately prepared for the next manual focus. Pressing the Push Auto button while in manual mode temporarily activates auto focus.Large Viewfinder and LCD MonitorThe large-diameter viewfinder tilts upward a full 100&#xB0;. You can move the viewfinder away from your eye and still see it clearly, making it easy to adopt a comfortable shooting stance with unobstructed forward vision. The 3.5-inch color LCD shows your subject in sharp, vivid detail and greatly simplifies menu settings. It rotates a full 270&#xB0; for shooting at a wide variety of angles and easy self-recording.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B000075AEV-A1YHQ1JWEJK6BI')" id="toggleBtn-B000075AEV-A1YHQ1JWEJK6BI">Show more</button>

Shooting 24 frames per second is one of the coolest and most useful features of this camera, if you are interested in converting to film, this is exactly what you want.The camera has a great view finder and LCD screen, it also has a a ton of options that really complete the package.  <mark>I have been looking for a while, the camera that is the next step above this is about $60,000, so this is definately a good starting camera and well worth the money, though make sure you shop around.The microphone works well, but I still went out and got a boom mic, it captures pictures in the dark wonderfully and the LCD screen lets you know if you are picking up sound or if there is over exsposure on something.</mark>  I haven't had time to figure out the entire camera yet, but this thing is definately leaps and bounds ahead of any competition at the moment, do not settle for second best, it is a distant second.</div>
      <div class="question">Is the microphone included?</div>
      <div class="answer">No its not</div>

      <div class="reviewText">Great sound, but burned out after just three hours of use. The volume was less than 1/3 up. What a crap!UPDATE (pretty belated)I had the product repaired, as it worked out the transformer that comes with it cannot handle anything beyond 110 volts. We have here 127 volts, sometimes "spiking" to 130. All electronics were fried. So, after the repair, I placed a voltage stabilizer before the product. <mark>My advise: if possible, buy the 220V version or do as I with the stabilizer.Pretty much one year later, I am still enjoying great sound and volume sometime up to 3/4!</mark> Like in The Italian Job movie, it blows the clothes off every woman :-)Bottom line: 5 stars for the working product, 1 star (or actually zero) for the electronics</div>

        <span class="summary">Nice little CB radio!</span>
      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">02 1, 2013</div>
      <div class="reviewText">CB radios were very popular in the 70s. 1 in 10 cars had one! In the mid 90s there was some what of a come back that may have lasted for a couple of years. In 2013 there really are not that many CB radios out there.  This is the reason I think some of the reviewers think their radio doesn't work, there is just nothing for them to pick up!  This being said, CB radio is still alive and used.  Truckers use them so you can always find out what the traffic is like, or where a speed trap is, and there are still people out there with base stations and mobile cbs providing for interesting conversation.  Just not as many as 35 yrs ago.  Having base stations, mobiles, and handhelds in the past I decided to re-enter the cb world with this Midland. It came nicely packaged with everything that is advertised. First I put batteries in it and listened in the house.  Heard truckers on 19 plus found that on 20 there is a whole group of locals that talk on their radios nightly. This was just using the included antenna.  Next I hooked it up to an old Firestik IBA5 Indoor Cb Base Antenna I had stored away, and I was picking up enough transmissions for the radio to be entertaining!  Next day I drove around with the radio in my F150 with the stock antenna and batteries. Nothing.  Not a single thing to be heard.  Last night I put a magnet mount Midland 18-2442 Mobile CB Antenna on top of my truck, and used the unique cable accessory that came with the radio. You snap it on to the bottom of the radio where the battery pack goes, and  you plug one connector into the cigarette lighter and the other to your antenna cable.  The radio pack and this device slide off very easily and slide back on securely, so you can attach it to the radio or take it off in a few seconds.  I ran the cable from the antenna through the door.  Closing the door on it was just fine  with no damage to the cable.  Now for the big test!  I drove 15 miles to work this morning during a major snow storm!  The radio worked like a charm.  I was picking up all the truckers (a lot of them) and getting reports of conditions around the whole area!  The rechargable battery pack allows you to run the radio home off of your AC current, or if you prefer use the regular battery pack for normal batteries, or use the car device with your cigarette lighter.  There are also jacks for a speaker and mike.  So essentially you can use this radio as a base station,  a mobile radio, or as a handheld!  Small enough to just slip in your pocket.  Also the sound, although not really loud, is vey clear and  easy to understand.  Radio also picks up the weather bands. I'm very happy with it.  I haven't transmitted to anybody yet, but I can tell transmit works well by testing it with an old handheld I had.  <mark>Distance would be measured by the type of antenna I use and how I tune it.</mark> Once I make a few contacts I'll get back here and let you know  how far I got. I buy radios for fun and in the week I've had this I have had a lot of fun with it, and would recommend it if you want to have some fun with cb radio.Update: Yesterday I was in a higher area (in my pick up using the Midland 18-2442 antenna) talking to a base station 7 miles away!  He said the radio sounded good!  So after using it for a few weeks now, I'm very satisfied and really glad I bought it!</div>
      <div class="question">So with the adapter, you can plug the radio into something and it will use your car antenna or some other antenna and get further range? How far?</div>
      <div class="answer">Range depends on the CB antenna used, and location. With just 5 watts, you could get 5miles if you were on the flatlands, or a desert. Out on the countryside maybe 3miles. In the city about a mile, maybe. If you use it inside the car with just the rubber duck antenna supplied, virtually nothing. You need a CB antenna mounted on the roof of your car. Cobra has a 36\" magnet mount CB antenna that works very well. Model HG A1500. In addition, you can use a linear amplifier to increase range (though it's illegal, it's commonly used) An RM KL-30 would increase your output to about 30watts, this increasing the range. Good luck.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">I used the Nexus 4 for about four or five months; a long period of time for a phone hound like me.I loved it. The resolution was stunning, the screen was great, and I loved how fast it was. Not to mention the support for the newest updates and the options for custom ROMs available.The only problem was that I needed to carry a cord with me to class to help keep it charged. <mark>If I didn't have a short charge mid-day, by 4PM its battery would be almost dead, guaranteed.</mark> I reduced the amount of time I used it during the day, which helped, but I want to be able to use my device.It is still a great phone, and will get updates for a while longer. I would recommend it, if you have no need for LTE.Also, the camera was just mediocre, but took decent enough pictures for Facebook, etc.</div>
      <div class="question">How long is the battery life? Hpw does the battery life compare to other phones?</div>
      <div class="answer">The battery lifeis about average. Keep in mind that this is a high performance phone. With a custom ROM and kernel you can improve battery life a bit. They can also be customized to enable the LTE radio for TMobile users. Excellent phone, excellent value, excellent development community at xda-forums due to it being such a popular device.</div>

      <div class="reviewText"><mark>This unit fits my 2000 Dodge Intrepid beautifully, but not so much the XO radio with USB and SD card slots.</mark> Although the Chrysler bracket is made of cast iron and weighs 11 pounds, this one is plastic, but pretty sturdy.  I had to use a bit of gorilla glue on the edge and bottom of the frame to hold the radio solidly in place as it was just a bit wide to accomodate those side "thingies" you see in the product photo.  So I had to install the radio without the thingies.  But it looks great and I am proud of myself.  Wifey thinks I am a true genius.</div>
      <div class="question">will this kit fit a XO Vision XD103 radio?</div>
      <div class="answer">The xo vision xo103 is a half din size radio. This mount is for a single din. You would have to modify the mount. Or try and find an adapter plate. I see no half din mounts for 98+ Dodge/Chrysler.</div>

        <p>A powerful zoom for capturing close, detailed views of faraway subjects, this high-magnification bea<span id="dots-B00021EE7W-A1GTC5U7G2YMSR">...</span><span id="more-B00021EE7W-A1GTC5U7G2YMSR" style="display:none">uty is the perfect choice for nature and sports shooters. Remarkably light and compact, it compresses the apparent distance between objects within the frame, giving stunning pictorial effects.Ultra telephoto shots further than the eye can seeThis is a zoom lens from Tamron that lets you bring your far away subjects up close while compressing the distance between the main subject and the background for professional-looking results. Even while covering up to a 500mm that enables you to take ultra telephoto shots of subjects further than the eye can see, its design is extremely lightweight and compact. When mounted on an APS-C size digital SLR camera, it provides a focal length equivalent to a 760mm for super ultra telephoto imaging.SP AF 200-500mm F/5-6.3 Di HighlightsEnhance the ease of your polarizing filter useFilter Effect Control (FEC)to Enhance the Operational Ease of your Polarizing Filter UseThe Filter Effect Control is designed to rotate the filter to the desired position while the hood is attached. This is accomplished by turning the FEC ring that in turn rotates the portion of the filter mount where the filter is mounted.Digitally Integrated (DI) Lenses for Top Imaging PerformanceDi (Digitally Integrated Design) is a Tamron designation that applies to lenses that have been optimized for digital capture using advanced multi-coating techniques and optical designs that assure excellent image quality across the entire picture field. Because of these characteristics, Di lenses provide outstanding performance on cameras with full-frame and APS-C format sensors as well as on 35mm film.Super Performance (SP) for Discriminating ShootersTamron SP (Super Performance) series is a line of ultra-high-performance lenses designed and manufactured to the exacting specifications demanded by professionals and others who require the highest possible image quality. In creating SP lenses Tamron&rsquo;s optical designers put their foremost priority on achieving superior performance parameters&mdash;they are all designed to a higher standard with little regard for cost constraints. As a result, Tamron lenses bearing the SP designation feature impressive and innovative designs that have established an enviable reputation for excellence among those knowledgeable photographers that demand the very best.Internal Focusing (IF) SystemInternal focusing provides numerous practical benefits to photographers including a non-rotating front filter ring that facilitates the positioning of polarizing and graduated filters, and more predictable handling because the lens length does not change during focusing. Even more important, Tamron&rsquo;s Internal Focusing (IF) system provides a much closer minimum focusing distance (MFD) throughout its entire focusing range. In addition, IF improves optical performance by minimizing illumination loss at the corners of the image field, and helps to suppress other aberrations that become more troublesome at different focusing positions.Low Dispersion (LD) glass reduces chromatic aberrationLow Dispersion (LD) Glass for Greater Lens SharpnessLow dispersion (LD) glass elements in a lens help reduce chromatic aberration; the tendency of light of different colors to come to different points of focus at the image plane. Chromatic aberration reduces the sharpness of an image, but glass with an extremely lowdispersion index, has less of a tendency to separate (defract) a ray of light into a rainbow of colors. This characteristic allows the lens designer to effectively compensate for chromatic aberration at the center of the field (on axis), a particular problem at long focal lengths (the telephoto end of the zoom range), and for lateral chromatic aberration (towards the edges of the field) that often occurs at short focal lengths (the wide-angle end of the zoom range.)</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B00021EE7W-A1GTC5U7G2YMSR')" id="toggleBtn-B00021EE7W-A1GTC5U7G2YMSR">Show more</button>

        <span class="summary">I'm betting that this lens gets better with time...</span>
      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">06 1, 2008</div>
      <div class="reviewText">I got this lens in the same set of purchases when I moved up from a Nikon D80 to a D300.  So naturally, I tried it out on both before I sold the D80.  Four stars on the D80; five on the D300.  <mark>What CA I saw on the D80 images disappeared on the images from the D300 - the D300 automatically corrected the CA.</mark>  This is why I say I think it will "improve" with age - the bodies will continually get better, and compensate for minor flaws.But in its own right, this lens is a significant value.  Not only in price, but in utility.  I had to ask myself if I would really use a lens in this range enough to want to hump it around (yes), if I really needed a fast lens in the 200-500mm range (no), or practically, if I could afford same (no).  I decided I didn't want to deal with the weight and bulk of a multi-thousand-dollar fast pro lens, and I certainly had better places to put my already out-of-control photography spending in relation to what would be my least used lens.Since I wanted this lens primarily for cruise side trips (whales, bears, bridges, foilage, etc) which usually take place during the middle of the day with lots of light, convenience/cost was much more important than sophistication.  I didn't need low light capability for sunrise/sunset landscapes, or to be sure to capture that one rare bird that only ventures out in the evening twilight.  Further, portability was important.  So, even though it's still the biggest space hog in the backpack along with four other lenses, all of which I use more than this one, the weight/bulk/cost to functionality ratio of this lens is still very acceptable to me.  One other thing - it comes with a high quality, very usable, padded case of its own if you don't have a dedicated photo backpack.Advice?  Use it on at least a monopod.  Even though it's light enough to be shot handheld, the images are highly dependent on good support.One small negative.  I've not found software yet which will automatically correct its barrel/pincushion distortion at various focal lengths.  Neither PTLens nor DXO have it in their databases, and I've not seen the compensation factors published for Photoshop.  While I am good enough to plug in factors that somebody smarter than me has figured out, I am not good enough to figure out those factors myself.  So if any readers here ever find them/figure them out, could you share?</div>
      <div class="question">Will it's at work with my Nikon D300</div>
      <div class="answer">The Info says the Nikon D300 one of the only Nikons that work with Tamron 200mm-500mm Lens. It will have a slow aperture at 500mm. The lens does not have an internal auto focus. But your camera does . So auto autofocus should work.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">I do video work and was attracted to the sale price and extra height of this particular tripod.  <mark>Come to find out, this model does not have a fluid head, meaning, if you do any panning with a camcorder, it won't be as smooth as you'd probably like it to be.</mark>  Also, at the end of a pan the head tends to "unwind," causing your panned image to back up a little ways.  Thus, I think it's rather misleading to label this as a "Photo / Video" tripod.Additionally, I don't really care for the cheap feel of some of the plastic knobs and adjusters.  Finally, mine came with a few, very minor cosmetic blemishes, almost as if it were used.Instead of video, I'll be utilizing this one as a microphone mount.If you want to do video, please buy a tripod with a fluid head.  You'll love it, I guarantee that.That's why I give this one 2 stars.</div>
      <div class="question">I have a digital camcorder and want to fill continuous video of moving people; how smooth is the panning with this tripod?</div>
      <div class="answer">I don't want to sound like a pretentious professional, but honestly? It's lackluster. You might end up being better off with spending another $50 to get a fluid head tripod, it's so incredibly worth it. The Ravelli AVT seems to be based on a Davis & Sanford design that i'm not quite fond of (fragile under heavy use) but is leagues, *light-years* ahead of this sad piece of plastic.</div>

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">05 10, 2005</div>
      <div class="reviewText">I live and camp in the western U.S. and have found this antenna to be very effective. <mark>It works either while driving down the road or while stationary, and it's not too difficult to attach it to your roof while in motion, unless it freaks out your cat when you open the window, but that's another issue.I've tried it on three phones, two Motorolas and an LG, and in all cases it usually brings the signal up by two bars.</mark> In areas with no signal, sometimes it allows weak analog service and sometimes it won't. Having this antenna has meant the difference between analog and digital service, or between no service and analog. Even if you are getting four or five bars, when you use this it seems that your calls will get dropped less often, or never.There are a few limitations:1. Your cell phone must accept an external antenna. Look for a hole near the base of the phone's antenna, which is often covered with a rubber plug.2. Many phones require an adapter to be used with this product. You will have to check with Wilson Electronics to see if this is the case. If it is, they cost about $10. Your cell phone store may also carry them.3. This thing works because it is attached to the roof of a vehicle. You can't carry it up on a hill and hold it in your hand - you have to be in the car. I have heard of people attaching it to an old-fashioned pie tin that is attached to some PVC pipe to get it six feet higher, but personally I haven't tried this.4. The cable between the antenna/car and your phone isn't very long, so plan on sitting in the car to use this.Overall, I am very pleased with this because it lets me check my e-mail while camping, which means I can play hooky from my job and not get caught.</div>
      <div class="question">I'm lookg for some antenna (with a magnet base, i'd prefer) for my car, in orden to increase my cellphone signal when I'm on the road. This is it?</div>
      <div class="answer">this antenna is designed to be used with Wilson's mobile signal booster. I can't comment on whether or not you can use it as a signal boosting element by itself. I use Wilson's mobile signal booster with it and it does a great job. The magnet is super strong. I would recommend placing it on the vehicle and leaving it. I moved mine back and forth between two vehicles and I noticed that the adhesive on the bottom that holds the magnet to the antenna loosened just a bit, but not separating. It comes with plenty of cable to place it in the center of a vehicle roof or trunk lid. It's worth the money getting the whole package. If you can get 1 bar on your cell, it will boost it to at least 3 bars. ( that's my experience) Hope this helps. side note: be sure you get the right booster for your particular carrier ( AT&Platinum, Verizon, Sprint...etc)</div>

      <div class="reviewText">I live and camp in the western U.S. and have found this antenna to be very effective. <mark>It works either while driving down the road or while stationary, and it's not too difficult to attach it to your roof while in motion, unless it freaks out your cat when you open the window, but that's another issue.I've tried it on three phones, two Motorolas and an LG, and in all cases it usually brings the signal up by two bars.</mark> In areas with no signal, sometimes it allows weak analog service and sometimes it won't. Having this antenna has meant the difference between analog and digital service, or between no service and analog. Even if you are getting four or five bars, when you use this it seems that your calls will get dropped less often, or never.There are a few limitations:1. Your cell phone must accept an external antenna. Look for a hole near the base of the phone's antenna, which is often covered with a rubber plug.2. Many phones require an adapter to be used with this product. You will have to check with Wilson Electronics to see if this is the case. If it is, they cost about $10. Your cell phone store may also carry them.3. This thing works because it is attached to the roof of a vehicle. You can't carry it up on a hill and hold it in your hand - you have to be in the car. I have heard of people attaching it to an old-fashioned pie tin that is attached to some PVC pipe to get it six feet higher, but personally I haven't tried this.4. The cable between the antenna/car and your phone isn't very long, so plan on sitting in the car to use this.Overall, I am very pleased with this because it lets me check my e-mail while camping, which means I can play hooky from my job and not get caught.</div>
      <div class="question">I'm lookg for some antenna (with a magnet base, i'd prefer) for my car, in orden to increase my cellphone signal when I'm on the road. This is it?</div>
      <div class="answer">this antenna is designed to be used with Wilson's mobile signal booster. I can't comment on whether or not you can use it as a signal boosting element by itself. I use Wilson's mobile signal booster with it and it does a great job. The magnet is super strong. I would recommend placing it on the vehicle and leaving it. I moved mine back and forth between two vehicles and I noticed that the adhesive on the bottom that holds the magnet to the antenna loosened just a bit, but not separating. It comes with plenty of cable to place it in the center of a vehicle roof or trunk lid. It's worth the money getting the whole package. If you can get 1 bar on your cell, it will boost it to at least 3 bars. ( that's my experience) Hope this helps. side note: be sure you get the right booster for your particular carrier ( AT&Platinum, Verizon, Sprint...etc)</div>

        <p>The Acoustimass 3 speaker system from Bose delivers surprisingly rich performance while practically <span id="dots-B00006J054-ADD4I3S2IGBCY">...</span><span id="more-B00006J054-ADD4I3S2IGBCY" style="display:none">disappearing into your d&#xE9;cor. The system, the company's smallest and most affordable to date, produces lifelike sound from your stereo components (DVD player, CD player, VCR, DVR, MP3 player, etc.) and, when connected to your surround sound receiver, it's also an appropriate choice for use as a left/right rear-channel home theater array. The speakers' compact size makes them a great choice for smaller rooms.Two single-cube speakers standing just 3 inches high are elegantly designed to blend with virtually any furnishings. Patented Acoustimass speaker technology delivers the ear-pleasing low tones of a bassoon or the deep, dramatic effects of movies. Best of all, you can easily stash the Acoustimass module behind furniture or in a corner, and the system's lifelike sound will appear to flow from the tiny cubes.Hookup couldn't be simpler: route left/right speaker wires (supplied) from your integrated amplifier or surround receiver to the back of the Acoustimass module (essentially a passive subwoofer), then run two more lengths between the Acoustimass module's left/right speaker outputs to the 2 cube speakers. All three units use convenient clip-type speaker terminals.When you hear the Acoustimass 3 Series IV system, you'll be surprised that such a huge sound can come from such small speakers. These Virtually Invisible speakers are the definitive answer to the question of how to combine spacious sound with space-saving design. It's all the result of Bose's years of intense research and testing.The tiny cube speakers can be wall-mounted or displayed on speaker stands using the optional Bose UFS-20 universal floor stands, UTS-20 universal table stand, or UB-20 wall/ceiling bracket. Now or in the future, you can turn your Acoustimass stereo speakers into a home theater set by simply adding the compatible Bose VCS-10 center-channel speaker. For full 5-speaker surround sound, add the VCS-30 center/surround speaker package.The system's four 20-foot lengths of speaker wire should accommodate most living rooms. For longer cable runs, however, Bose recommends using 2-conductor, 18-gauge wire (30 feet), 16-gauge wire (45 feet), or 14-gauge wire (70 feet), for a hookup that maintains a maximum frequency-response deviation of +/- 0.5 dB. (Cable thickness increases as gauge decreases.)What's in the BoxTwo cube speakers, 1 powered Acoustimass module, 4 lengths of speaker wire (20 feet each), 4 adhesive rubber feet, and a user's manual with warranty/registration information</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B00006J054-ADD4I3S2IGBCY')" id="toggleBtn-B00006J054-ADD4I3S2IGBCY">Show more</button>

      <div class="reviewText">The Acousticmass 3 series IV is a great sound set for the price! It delivers far better highs and lows than I expected. <mark>This is an excellent choice if you have s two channel system and would like more bass or have a multiple zone system and would like to have a good sound system in a separate room.However, if you are planning on adding this to an existing 5.1 or 7.1 system be aware that the Bose Acousticmass 3 series IV has only two connections, a Left and Right, from the bass module, and the cube speakers connect to the bass module to balance the range.</mark> The manual specifically states NOT to connect the speakers nor the bass module differently as it may damage the units.I am currently using the Bose Acousticmass 3 series IV as the rear channels in conjunction with a pair of Bose 201 for the Front channels for in the TV room--it sounds great! I have cranked up the sound for both movies and audio CDs and I am very pleased with both. Great price for the sound quality!</div>
      <div class="question">I have a 5.1 surround (Energy) and want to add two more speakers to make it 7.1 in my media room. Does these speakers can be used as two extra speaker . Also I would like to use the subwoofer in my living room with JBL BD100 speakers as the subwoofer...</div>
      <div class="answer">Simply adding two more speakers to your system does not make it a 7.1. You risk burning up the amplifier by having speakers with mismatched impendences. Upgrading your speakers is great but speaker impedances have to match and your amp has to say it can handle that load. Far more bad scenarios then good for what you are looking to do.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">This tripod is smooth.  I know its not a professional tripod, but it is silent.  I had other tripods that I purchased from Samsonite.  Out of the box, they needed WD-40.  This tripod is lightweight. At times it seems a little too flimsy, but it hold my Sony HDR-FX1 and my Canon XH-A1 prosumer camcoders.I had a special training I needed to record and place on DVD.  Because of the squeaking of the cheaper tripods, I could hear EVERY move I made with that tripod.  <mark>This is what prompted me to purchase this one.Others said that this tripod only works with Sony (as what Sony's website also says), but I found that to be false because it works my Canon very well... from the power to the zoom and record, it has no problems.</mark>  Also, not having to even touch the camcorder cuts down on shifting and movement of the camcorder.  I am going to buy  another because I am pleased with the performance.</div>

There were a few things i did not know about this before i bought it, maybe other people could use this info as well1)Gives you about arms reach distance between camera and flash, can probably be uncoiled with heat, but dont expect to put it more than 3 feet before it starts pulling on the stands. <mark>Perfect if you want to just hold it in your hand and get different light effects.2) Has a switch on the front that either allows the AF illuminator in the flash or the termial on the hot shoe of the camera.</mark> One or the other. Cant use both. I doubt anyone would need both though.3) No PC connection. I read that the SC-28 has one though4) it does have the shoe locks.5) Worth every penny.</div>

      <div class="answer">Yes, for me it comes out of either the hot shoe or the flash. I haven't used it in a while, so I'm not sure how exactly it was switched and it might depend on the flash and the body for how to set that.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">I bought this as a replacement but genuine Samsung battery for my Galaxy SIII phone in April, 2013.Update July, 2013:WARNING: I actually got what seems to be a fake.  While plugged into the charger, it only charges to 85%, but then jumps up to 90-95% when unplugged from the charger!The two physical differences I could spot between the fake and the original battery are:1) The fake has no white water-damage sticker on the bottom edge (same edge as the electrical contacts).2) Edge opposite electrical contacts on fake has what looks like a *matte plastic* "hump" running along most of its length, with a short gap in the middle. The real battery has a narrow *shiny smooth plastic* ridge, with a small round hole or molding mark in the middle. There are narrow recessed flat strips, also shiny plastic, flanking the ridge on both sides in the real battery; in the fake, the center matte plastic hump just sort of blends to the side matte areas.My earlier review: (wrong!)I purchased it from Amazon itself as the actual vendor, not just "fulfilled by".  <mark>Sure enough, I got an actual genuine Samsung battery, essentially indistinguishable from the battery that originally came with my Galaxy SIII when I bought it in January, 2013.</mark>  So far, it works fine in the phone.If customer photos are enabled here, I will try to load some photos I took of a genuine battery.  Note that now even genuine Samsung batteries sometimes have the battery cells made in Korea, but the whole battery assembled in China.  This was true for both the battery that came with my phone from Samsung, and the replacement Samsung battery I bought here.</div>
      <div class="question">I'm reading that some people have problems with the battery not fully charging, or draining quickly. Would this be the battery problem or an issue with the Galaxy S III phone? My phone is two months old, battery new with phone, and the phone itself...</div>
      <div class="answer">I hope that helps. I had the same problem. That is why I ordered the new battery. Battery was fine. It was my 8 month old phone which was still under warranty. Now I am scared so I took out insurance. I know have a spare battery if I ever need it.</div>

I was extremely disappointed.  <mark>The case I received was defective and would not secure my 8in tablet.</mark> Customer service was pleasant and promptly responded to refund request. Not worth the hassle. Save your precious time and money! Try I-unik cases instead. If available for you tablet,  their cases are amazing and worth every penny!</div>

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">04 29, 2012</div>
      <div class="reviewText">As a bit of a vinyl nerd, I was looking for something to travel with. When I visit new towns, I like to seek out local record stores. Before now, that meant waiting until I got home to enjoy all my new vinyl. The Ion iPTUSB makes a great traveling companion for vinyl lovers. It's not the world's greatest turntable, but for what it is - it is pretty awesome!The sound quality is great for the price too. <mark>Although its single built-in speaker leaves a lot to be desired, it does sound really good through headphones or a decent set of computer speakers.</mark> I do think a cartridge upgrade may be a good investment though.It runs on six D batteries or an included AC adapter. 3 speeds, tone, pitch, and gain controls allow you to play just about anything you could want to play. I have yet to use the USB feature, but other reviews I've read seem to suggest it's pretty user-friendly.This is not an audiophile's turntable, but it is a great, budget-friendly option. I love my portable new friend!</div>
      <div class="question">how is the sound quality. The Crosley portable turntables with built in speaker are much cheaper but have horrible sound.? Thanks.</div>
      <div class="answer">It does the job. But when you plug it in or use head phones. The turn table sounds great.</div>

The MC401 runs on a 9-volt battery, but I separately ordered this 9-volt Dunlop ECB003 AC adapter, which is also available at Amazon. I checked the Jim Dunlop website and in its FACs it specifically recommends staying with the same voltage adapter, so I did not order the ECB004, which is an 18-volt model. <mark>The ECB003 adapter works perfectly and seems completely silent.</mark> They obviously have changed the design, because the one they sent me is much more compact than the picture. In fact, at 1.5"x2.5"x1.25" it is a match for the smallest wall-wart adapter I own. I don't see how it could be better. Perfect.</div>

      <div class="answer">the Nissan Patrol is equal to the Nissan Armada in the USA, this harness may Fit. The plugs connect to your Factory harness. The bare Wire side connects To your a = Ter The harness may fit your patrol if it has the basic radio. If your patrol has a the Bose version or the Rockford Fosgate version it will not work. To use this harness, you first have to match the bare-wire side of each wire to the proper connection on your aftermarket radio, then butt-splice or solder them together.... The plug-end connects to you vehicles car-stereo wiring harness. One plug has power and front speakers, the other has rear speakers. You need to know there is not a ground wire in this harness, so ground your radio directly to the vehicles frame. Just in case, maybe you should dissconnect your car battery negative cable before you start, Good luck!</div>

Cobra has brought back  their version of the CB with this 29-LTD. They've made some nice improvements to the CB you  might have used a decade or two ago. Key improvements to this radio include a front panel  microphone connector which makes in-dash installation a cinch. Cobra has also provided a nine  foot microphone cord so that you keep in touch from a good distance, whether you're located in  a truck cab or dispatch office. The final noteworthy improvement are tactile controls for safer,  and more accurate, functionality. Other features include: antenna warning indicator, SWR  calibration, instant Channel 9, PA capability, dimmer control, switchable noise blanker and RF  gain. In a time of seemingly un-ending technological advances, it's nice to see something we  created back in the late 1930s is still alive and kicking.What's in the BoxOne 29-LTD CB radio, nine foot microphone cord, transceiver bracket, microphone bracket, DC  power cord, a user's manual, and a two year limited warranty.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B00006JPF3-A3F9EJII9792OZ')" id="toggleBtn-B00006JPF3-A3F9EJII9792OZ">Show more</button>

      <div class="reviewText">This CB is outstanding.  It may be a tad pricy but with a cheaper CB its hard to understand people. First off I ordered this CB on a Saturday.  The estimated shipping date was next Friday to Tuesday.  This was a problem as I really wanted the cab by Thursday so I could mount it and have it for a road trip I was about to take.  The package came in a day early.  This shipped from California and I live on the east coast of Maryland.  I used standard 3-5 day shipping. Very pleased.  Next the box has minimal damage.  And by minimal I mean the corners were messed up but that was expected with a coast to coast shipment.  However when I opened the box the radio was covered in bubble wrap and looked factory fresh very pleased with that.  Now the actual radio is nice its easy to calibrate the directions are in AMERICAN English only and are short and simple to read.  Next the install. I took off my radio cover. And ran my antenna wire through my dampners in my pickup. The Antenna is roof mounted and I ran my radio cord through my radio etc.  Next the power cord its a plug for the back of the cab a fuse and the other end is a piece of stripped wire.  The whole thing is about 5 food long.  If your not experienced with cars or wire splicing I would reccomend getting the cigarette lighter adapter.  However if you think you can do it.  <mark>I just spliced the hot and neutral in with my cigarette lighter and it works fine and my cigarette light will still charge my phone.</mark>  Lastly you can hardwire to your battery the only reason is because the CB lights up and is easy to tell when its on.  Just remember the antenna really determines how far your signal is.  I hooked up a small PA system with my CB but beware while this isn't illegal where I live a cop can and will usually give you shit if they hear it.  Other than that this is a great looking quality inexpensive ( not cheap inexpensive for the quality) cab.PS when I mounted my radio bracket I used all four self tapping screws on the mount.  Your oonly supposed to use two for the radio bracket and the other two are for the mic holder.  I didn't know this so I just used two more self tapping screws I had lying around for the mic mount.Hope this helps</div>
      <div class="question">Does it get power via the cigarette lighter?</div>
      <div class="answer">I guess if u have an adapter</div>

Well then the Nook Tablet is the tablet for you!  It's got about a seven and a half inch screen with beautiful high resolution graphics.  The nook tablet is an awesome device with many unique features for the whole family.The Nook Tablets appstore is the first thing I will talk about.  It has many great games that everyone can play and apps the whole family can enjoy.  Angry birds, Balloons Tower Defense four, Netflix, and Facebook are just some of the great apps you can find on the Nooks appstore.  The graphics are great to as I said before.  <mark>Not only on the games is everything HD but Netflix, Hulu and the home screen graphics.My little brother and I use this every day for everything we desire, such as internet browsing, homework, games and watching Netflix after a long day of school.</mark>  It truly has everything a person could desire and more.  The fact that my whole family uses it is a true testament to that.  Overall the Nook Tablet is the most useful electronic I own and I know you will enjoy this if you do decide to be smart and by this product.</div>

      <div class="reviewTime">07 6, 2012</div>
      <div class="reviewText">This product is really great and works really well. Each wire's function is described on the back of the packaging using the color coding system. So, if you do not know what you are doing, this really helps.So, I want to help others (if possible) using my medium amount of experience (I have done stereo removals and installs in several cars) so here are my tips if you are doing this for the first time:1. Buy a in-dash stereo mounting kit for your car. This is a must so the stereo will fit in your car securely. Amazon has a whole bunch so you can most likely find the one you need. Here is an example of the one I used: [...] (I hope these links work).2. Buy a radio/stereo wiring harness that matches your car. You hopefully are doing this right now with this product.3. Buy the proper tools to get your old stereo out and the new one in: Wire strippers (if you don't already have them), butt splices/connectors (for the wires), and auto fastener/remover tools ([...] or "Astro Pneumatic 4505 5-Piece Fastener and Molding Remover Set" is the set I used and recommend).4. <mark>In regards to wiring the new stereo, if you don't know what you are doing, watch this video: "How to wire / install a car stereo / deck (aftermarket head unit installation with butt connectors)" = [...]5. if you are a beginner, get a friend or someone to help you do it because it is always nice to have another pair of hands and another opinion when you are doing it.6.</mark> In regards to taking out your old stereo, look for a stereo removal video on youtube that matches your car. Those are a huge help. Here is the one I found highly useful for my Toyota Corolla: "Radio Removal Toyota Corolla 2003 -2008" on youtube or directly = [...]7. Have fun doing it! I really enjoy doing this and I hope you do to!If you have any other questions, just comment on this review and I will try to get back to you and help you out as soon as I can. I hope this helped and best of luck to you.</div>

        <p>Canon raises the stakes for professional photography with its EF 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6 DO IS USM teleph<span id="dots-B0001G6U3Y-A2B5RWNN9JQP50">...</span><span id="more-B0001G6U3Y-A2B5RWNN9JQP50" style="display:none">oto lens with image stabilization. Thanks to a new triple-layered diffractive optical element (DO), this 70-300mm lens is less than 4 inches (10 cm) long. It can focus down to 4.6 feet (without rotating the front element) and a new zoom lock button keeps the lens safe and secure when not in use or used at the wide angle. A virtually silent ultra-sonic motor (USM) gives the lens extremely fast autofocus. The lens also includes Canon's Image Stabilization technology to dramatically reduce camera shake, compensating for approximately three stops in shutter speed without any perceptible increase in image blur. It's a great choice for professional photojournalists and serious advanced amateurs who need to contain the size and weight of equipment carried.DO ElementsUse of the new three-layer DO lens drastically reduces the overall length and weight of the lens system increasing the refractive power of each lens element and reducing the spaces between elements. It's approximately 26 percent shorter and 36 percent lighter than any lens of comparable specifications.Zoom lockThe EF 70-300mm lens features a zoom ring locking mechanism, locking the lens at its shortest total length. This helps to protect the lens from potential damage by preventing the zoom elements extending under their own weight, which might otherwise occur when the lens is mounted to a camera that hangs from a neck or shoulder strap.Image StabilizationThe lens incorporates Canon's Image Stabilization (IS) technology, compensating for approximately three stops without any perceptible increase in image blur when shooting static subjects or panning. This increases the range of circumstances in which hand-held photography is possible, limiting the need to carry a tripod.Fast AFA rear focusing ring type USM, high-speed CPU and new AF algorithms combine to give the lens extremely fast auto-focusing. The ring-type ultrasonic motor (USM) converts ultrasonic vibrational energy into rotational force to deliver high-speed, high-precision, super efficient and virtually noiseless auto focusing, with good holding torque for rapid response and accurate stopping. Full-time manual override is featured, removing the possibility of damage to the autofocus mechanism during manual focus. The lens has a minimum focusing distance of just 1.4m throughout the entire zoom range.Ready for Digital PhotographyThe lens shape and coatings have been optimized to suppress ghosting and flaring, making this lens ideal for use with digital cameras that are more susceptible to reflections off the recording media than are film cameras.Working with EOSThe drive pattern of the lens is tailored to specifically match that of the latest EOS range, extracting maximum benefit from the lens' speed advantage. The lens comes with a case LP1116 and an exclusive hood ET-65B for shading against unwanted direct light.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B0001G6U3Y-A2B5RWNN9JQP50')" id="toggleBtn-B0001G6U3Y-A2B5RWNN9JQP50">Show more</button>

        <span class="summary">Great travel lens: light and small for a quality 70-300mm zoom</span>
      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">09 7, 2006</div>
      <div class="reviewText">I bought this to have a good zoom to pair with my Rebel XT (350D) on backpacking trips. It weighs far less than the other options at the same size (particularly the L glass). Additionally, it is physically small for such a high power zoom. This combined with its being black makes it a fun lens to "walk around with" for candid shots since it doesn't draw much attention. As for backpacking, it is fabulous: light, small, and gives me a reasonable amount of reach for wildlife and nature shots. I've not yet paired it with a teleconverter, but, I intend to do so.I think that the optics of the lens have caused glass snobs to scoff at it and look for *any* possible flaw, with the biggest complaint in reviews being about bokeh. In real life, I can only recall about three shots out of several thousand where I have seen the negative effects mentioned -- you need to have background light hitting the lens at just the right angle. In one of the cases I liked the results, in the other I moved slightly. photoshop could easily rectify the output, too.I've found the focus on this lens to be much faster than the kit lens from the 350D and somewhat faster than my 50mm prime. The stabilization is pretty good, too. <mark>I've handheld 1/5sec shots of waterfalls with it to good result; just remember that it doesn't hold your subject still so it won't help as much for sports or wildlife.I didn't like the little bag that came to hold the lens when it isn't being used.</mark> If you plan on taking this lens with you backpacking/hiking/etc, I'd seriously consider using a purpose built camera bag with lens holders or a hard container.One other thing to keep in mind is that this is not the fastest lens (f/4.5-f/5.6), if you do a lot of low light or high speed photography, you'll either be shooting at higher ISO settings or slower lens speeds than with the L series lenses.</div>
      <div class="question">is it good for sports action photos?</div>
      <div class="answer">Sam, I did comparisons with both the DO and the zoom 70-300mm. To me the DO lens was less sharp than the conventional zoom lens another factor while holding the shorter DO lens it was harder to keep the camera still little area to hold and steady the lens with your left hand the longer zoom lens was easier to stabilize and felt better in hand. However it would really depend upon the distance of your players and how close do you want to photo them. For great close up shots you may have to go to at least a 400mm or greater to get magazine like shots.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">I purchased this Palm m500 to replace an older one that got damaged in a move.  I primarily want it to keep organized and make grocery lists. The price was excellent.It arrived fast and in great condition.  It was purchased as new and it came new with it's own leather case. The Software that came with it easy to use, as well as the cables to Hot Synk and charge.  The Cradel feature is not really a necessity, unless some really preffer it then it would be an extra accessory. It has lots of features that I would never use, but other customers might, including advance calculations.The Display is excellent. There is no need for color display. Even though I do play some games such as solitair, black and white quite sufficient and clear.  Memory is more than adequate. After installing all I wanted and needed, including about 4 games I still have 3/4 free space.  <mark>I do not connect to the internet with it, but it does have that capability.I appreciate the price I paid for it, it was well worth it.</mark>  Seller always answered email in timely manner and answered all questions to my satisfaction. Shipping was great and arrived fast.I love my Palm m500</div>
      <div class="question">does it connect to the internet</div>
      <div class="answer">I was never able to do that. I got locked out of it when it wouldn't respond to my password so I sent it back.</div>

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">12 27, 2010</div>
      <div class="reviewText">I don't know where to begin. Why not with the negative since most people buy speakers for music. If you are looking for a good pair of speakers and are planning on using them to listen to music, avoid these at all costs. They have horrible range. Imagine having bass that has so much boom that it distracts you from the other parts of the music. That's right, these speakers have way too much bass, and the bass is also a bit distorted. At first this may seem cool, if you are into music with deep bass and boombox type music. But if you like listening to rock, metal, jazz, blues, pop, soul, funk, country, psychedelic, alternative, indie, and pretty much anything that doesn't solely rely on bass. There is basically no middle range either, which means most songs you are listening to will be limited in range, which is always bad. You want to hear the middle range, music isn't only about the bass and treble unless you're talking about rap maybe. The high range is really the only decent things about these speakers. They capture the high range pretty well without distorting it. But without significant middle range and overpowering bass, this isn't that much of an advantage. The only types of music I could potentially see working on these speakers are rap and maybe certain types of classical and electronic, oh and bass only songs. You probably want to look for more expensive speakers if you want good middle range and music listening speakers.Now for movies and video games. These speakers will work well if you plan on watching movies or play video games since middle range isn't that important, unless you are playing music video games or watching a musical. They have excellent treble, which make them ideal for movies and video games where high ranges or frequent. Even the boomy bass can come in handy and add suspense during movies. <mark>So if you plan on buying these for movies or video games, I would say they will do the job pretty well for a cheap price.So in conclusion buy these speakers ifYou plan on mainly using them for video games and moviesYou don't plan on using them much for music (or just plan on using them for playing music at parties)Listen exclusively to music like rap and electronic where middle range doesn't matter muchDon't buy these speakers ifYou are looking for good music speakers that capture the full range of the music you are listening toPlan on mainly using these speakers for music other than rap and electronicHate boomy bassRarely watch movies or play video games with speakers</mark></div>

      <div class="answer">Don't know about Jeep since mine was for a Dodge Ram 1500, but if it was the thicker unit with multi disc then it might fit. Opening is pretty slim, can't fit much there, maybe a very slim phone with no cover on it or a few cds. Mine's empty since I just use a 32GB usb drive for all my music, the kind that is just a stub so it isn't even noticeable.</div>

      <div class="question">is this considered a filtered power strip?</div>
      <div class="answer">The description given for this product can be confusing when it refers to \"line noise.\" These inexpensive strips usually use devices called Metal Oxide Varistors to prevent voltage spikes above a predetermined threshold while they last. If you need a cleaner filter, a \"power conditioner/line conditioner\" might be what you are looking for. They contain additional circuitry to filter out ripple and unwanted frequencies for more demanding applications such as for pro audio equipment as an example. The TLP602 is not that. When I see \"filtered power strip\" I think power conditioner. Hope this helps.</div>

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">02 27, 2014</div>
      <div class="reviewText">Review for: Tripp Lite ISOBAR8ULTRA Surge ProtectorOVERVIEW:-----------The ISOBAR8ULTRA is a high quality value sweet spot among premium surge protectors.  It offers UL 1449 3rd Edition verified surge protection with excellent EMI/RFI AC line noise protection.This is a premium surge protector offering from a company that takes surge protection seriously.PROS IT HAS IN COMMON WITHALL ISOBAR SURGE SUPPRESSORS:---------------------------------The ISOBAR/ISOTEL line of surge protectors is technically respected, the line has been around over 20 years and they have sold almost 20 million of them.  Even their plug receptacles are high quality.  These are a great value.Some key ISOBAR/ISOTEL benefits:(1)  UL1449 3RD EDITION TESTED (see below for details) with let through 140V RMS "CLAMPING" VOLTAGE (UL Verified at 330V).  This means at 140V it starts passing the over voltage to electrical ground.  If a surge protector doesn't have a clamping voltage at 330V or lower, consider looking for one that does if you are serious about surge protection.(2)  ISOLATED FILTER BANKS.  Some equipment send more noise than others back down their AC cords.  The isolated filter banks eliminate interference between equipment in this regard.  Each of the 4 pairs of outlets is isolated from each other.  For example, you might isolate equipment with motors like DVRs and DVD players from noise sensitive equipment like TV and speakers.(3)  SURVIVABILITY, unlike many surge protectors this isn't designed to be a disposable product.  ISOBAR surge protectors are designed to be highly survivable in addition to doing their job of protecting your equipment.  And if it does sacrifice itself protecting your equipment there is a good chance the company will send you a new one at no cost.  See warranty details to be sure you can qualify.  Comments on sites suggest they take their lifetime warranty and equipment protection guarantee seriously.  There is circuit breaker (12A) built-in too, of course.(4)  EMI/RFI FILTERING, the db noise attenuation level is model dependent and is superb on this one maxing out at 80 dB.(5)  A tough all metal housing, thus for example no melting plastic cases in extreme conditions.(6)  For over 20 years, the ISOBAR line has committed to the technical high-road and showed product durability/survivability over the long haul and the company appears to make a good faith effort to honor their warranty.NOTE:  The rest of the benefit laundry list I won't cover as they are to be expected for any premium surge protector and there is nothing to clarify or add:- expected status indicators- high joules protection- thermal fusing to avoid fires, etc.- etc.CONS:------- Outlets not very spread out, will require mini-extension cords if there are a lot of transformers to put on.  Four transformers would likely fill it up, for example.  Consider its HT10DBS cousin if requiring more outlet real estate.Tripp Lite HT10DBS Home Theater Isobar Surge Protector 10 Outlet RJ11 RJ45 Coax- No surge protection for Ethernet, coaxial cable, or DSL/telephone, if that is important to you.  Many computer and media center set-ups could use that.  Again, consider the HT10DBS if that might be useful.UL1449 3rd EDITION - WHY DEMAND IT ATTHE MINIMUM FOR YOUR SURGE PROTECTOR:-------------------------------------------Okay, so you read somewhere that you want a UL1449 verified/tested product and preferably a maximum of 330V let-through clamping voltage, &lt;1 nanosecond response time, etc., but what added value does UL1449 3RD EDITION give us?UL1449 3rd Edition became effective 09/2009.  Any surge protection device (SPD) made after that must meet the new tests to continue to be UL1449 verified at all, not just 3rd edition.  Why choose a product that meets the new edition of the certification (much less meets any old UL1449 cert.) if you are serious about protecting your equipment?  Here are two reasons:(1)  It added a STRESS TEST for Type 3 SPDs like this called the Duty Cycle Test.  They electrically whack it 15x to see if they can ruin its ability to protect, cause a fire, etc.(2)  The UL1449 3rd Edition tests with 6x MORE SURGE AMPERAGE than the 2nd Edition test did.A surge protector that says it is UL Listed MAY NOT BE, and often isn't, UL1449 3rd Edition listed.  For example, it may only be UL1283 listed (or one would hope rarely, even UL1449 2nd Edition listed in the past and not following the rules for listing continuation).  Watch out for carefully constructed marketing that really is just claiming to be as good as UL1449 listed/verified, instead of actually being UL1449 listed/verified.SOME SELECT NOTES FROMINSTRUCTIONS AND ELSEWHERE:(Reworded for brevity)-------------------------------- Plug the unit directly into the wall socket, don't daisy chain extension cords.- If socket is ungrounded, surge protection won't work, be sure warning light shows socket has ground.  <mark>At least you'll get EMI/RFI noise reduction for the outlets, but without ground you've got an extension cord not a surge protector.- If you are serious about surge protection from nearby lightning strikes or power line events, be sure to get whole house surge suppression in addition to these kinds of surge protector units (unit and installation can be as little as $200ish, Note: Get a unit with status indicators).- The on/off switch (which doubles as a circuit breaker) takes just enough force to make it a little more cat proof than some others.- Under UL 1449 3rd Edition, these kinds of surge protectors are Type 3, which are partly defined as being 30'+ from circuit breaker box.</mark>  This is why you will see reference to premium surge protectors being 30ft. from a circuit breaker box.  It doesn't mean that at 29.9' your surge protector will go nuclear.SOME OTHER UL1449 3rd EDITIONSURGE PROTECTORS:---------------------------------- FURMAN:Furman PST-8 Power Station Series AC Power ConditionerFurman PST 8D Advanced Level Power Conditioning, SMP, EVS, LiFT, 15 Amp, Aluminum Chassis, 8 Outlets, Isolated Outlet Banks, Cable & Telco Protection- WALL PLUG-IN:TRIPP LITE SK5TEL-0 Surge Protector Wallmount Direct Plug in 5 Outlet RJ11 1080 Joule- ISOBAR:Tripp Lite ISOBAR6 Isobar Surge Protector Metal 6 Outlet 6 feet Cord 3330 JoulesTripp Lite ISOBAR6ULTRA Isobar Surge Protector Metal 6 Outlet 6ft Cord 3330 Joules- ISOTEL:Tripp Lite ISOTEL8ULTRA 8-Outlet ISOTEL Surge Protector (3840 Joules, Tel/DSL)- AUDIO/VIDEO:Tripp Lite HT10DBS Home Theater Isobar Surge Protector 10 Outlet RJ11 RJ45 CoaxTRIPP LITE AVBAR8 Isobar Metal RJ11 RJ45 Coax 8 Outlet 8-Feet Cord A/V Surge Protector- Check this out for fun, a super premium AV-focused option:Furman Elite-20 PF i 13-Outlet Ultra Linear AC Power SourceMonster doesn't publish whether or not some of their surge protectors are UL1449 or UL1449 3rd Edition verified, but they are considering doing so some day.  They also don't publish their surge protectors EMI/RFI noise attenuation, but they are considering doing so in the future, as well.  Obviously many folks and companies serious about surge protection are not likely to use surge protection that doesn't show UL1449 listing.SOME RELATED PRODUCTSOTHER UL LISTINGS:-------------------------UL497A/UL1459 - Relates to Telco (ex: RJ11 protection in our case)UL 991 - Tests for safety-related controls using solid state devicesUL 1283 - EMI Filtering for these kinds of unitsUL 1363 - "Relocatable power taps" (think extension cords) with or without EMI filtering or surge protection</div>
      <div class="question">My old building isn't grounded. Does ISOBAR8ULTRA offers any protection against lightning surges?</div>
      <div class="answer">Site-of-use surge protectors must be used in a properly grounded receptacle. Service entrance types (where the wiring comes into your home/building) do also.</div>

        <span class="summary">The Truth about these Headphones...</span>
      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">03 3, 2010</div>
      <div class="reviewText">I'm a drummer and have been involved with music - in some form or fashion - for more than 40 years. One of my current gigs involves playing a drumset enclosed within a sound booth. Isolation headphones are an absolute necessity in this setting. My old headphones were well worn and I did do a good bit of research for a replacement pair. Most "pro" studio headphones are $150+ and I didn't want to drop that much for them. When I saw the Koss QZ-99's, read the reviews (most of which were good), and saw the price (forty bucks even - shipped - on Ebay)- I decided to give them a try. Well, they are rather suitable for my purposes - they do a fair job cutting the background noise - are decently constructed with metal supports rather than the soon-broken plastic used on most of today's headphones - and will probably hold up well. They fit snuggly - perhaps just a bit too snuggly - but, again, that is desirable for my purposes. I don't want them flying off while I'm playing. So - they do fill a need for me - and relatively inexpensively compared to most other options.Now for the bad news - the sound quality from these headphones is mediocre at best and they can be uncomfortable to wear. Bass response is very poor - and if you try to accentuate the bass, you'll get an annoying rattle in both earpieces. Since the sound elements can't keep up, I really don't believe they would hold up long with boosted-bass settings. The treble also seems just a bit clipped... I'd characterize the sound as slightly "muddy" in general. These are by no means "audiophile" quality headphones - I've had inexpensive headphones from discount stores that could easily match - and, in some cases, exceed - the sound quality of the Koss QZ-99's. Almost all but the smallest heads out there will probably find them too tight (and a bit too heavy) for prolonged wearing without discomfort. <mark>As the Amazon description states - these might be "ideal for use with racing scanners and metal detectors" - but they are by no means for the casual and comfortable listening of music.One thing that seriously disturbs me reading some of the other reviews here is how often these are promoted for use when using power tools and equipment.</mark> By no means should you be listening to music - or other audio sources - while operating chainsaws, mowers, power saws, etc. Doing such is simply beyond stupid and can be quite dangerous to you - and to those around you. Certainly you should make every effort to protect your hearing with passive (non-speaker) headphones or earplugs when exposed to loud equipment - but you certainly don't need your attention distracted by music.So - I'm relatively satisfied with these for my intended purposes (studio isolation) and they would likely be a tolerable match for metal detectors and even for scanners on race day. However - if you buy them solely to listen to music and expect to have a pleasant and comfortable experience - you're very likely to be very, very disappointed..... and if you plan to use them while operating potentially-dangerous power equipment - you are a complete moron....</div>
      <div class="question">see that " Ideal for use with racing scanners and metal detectors", this isn't use for music ?? is this 3.5 jack</div>
      <div class="answer">Sorry for the late reply. The answer is yes, it has a 3.5 mm minijack and it comes with an adapter to 6.3 mm jack. I'm using it for music at home. It closes out noises and other disturbance whilst listening to music. It doesn't pick up static noise like some noise cancelling phones does. It has a crystal clear sound and a volume control. I suppose it can be used for other purposes too, but I was looking for a pair of headsets that is keeping the noise out without having to use batteries and an active noise cancellation system. I would say that this headset is serving my purpose.</div>

      <div class="reviewTime">01 31, 2009</div>
      <div class="reviewText">I have a very nice stereo surround sound speaker setup that sounds great, but living in an apartment and aware of the noise my video game habit makes, I wanted to find headphones that match the quality sound of my speakers.  I seem to have found it with these.  I can finally crank up the volume on my video games without worrying about what my neighbors are thinking of me.  It's really made me very happy.  They are extremely comfortable and I can wear them for 5 hour stretches with no fatigue.  I'm very happy with my decision.  <mark>I also can't believe the bass coming from these headphones, I never head such a range of sound before.My only suggestion to Sennheiser would be to instead of packing these in a ridiculously HUGE box that I threw away immediately (it also stank), to please include the little headphone hanger/clip thingie that my cheaper HD 485's came with.</mark>  I'm using that instead of the box daily.</div>
      <div class="question">bass response?</div>
      <div class="answer">Right where I like it - crisp and clean. Have been listening to some HiDef Yes albums and Chris' Rickenbacher has never sounded better. What I hated about my old phones was that the timpani and low strings in a lot of classical music were muddy and/or distorted. On these, those sounds are clean and full, with plenty of boom :-) Balance is a good word for the 600's. Depends really on what your primary genres are.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">I purchased my SanDisk years ago. It came with software, including a driver, which appears to be mandatory on my systems but I don't mind. <mark>Contrary to what others write, on my now Vista system, I can use 2 GB SD cards without any hitch.</mark> Moreover, I have a PhotoShop Elemements 7 reader and a PaintShop Pro reader loaded. None conflict and any one of them will automatically read the pix into their respective program when the program is loaded and the reader is triggered. I really didn't know these things could be problematic when I bought mine, I just wanted the free PhotoShop mini-Elements software that came with it. Over the years, I've learned to avoid small companies or to go on the cheap. That's bad for the new guy and doesn't always work, but as a rule it does. SanDisk had proven themselves, so I went with this product, then the most expensive one they made.UPDATE!About 3 months ago I had some problems that I thought were my fault. The images on the memory card were being copied back to the memory card. At first it seemed like no major problem because I wasn't losing images. But then the poop hit the fan. My sister and her husband lent me their one memory card with three major vacations: Israel, Europe and Canada. When this unit doubled the images twice, the memory card ran out of memory and then it started losing images! Since I had already copied most images to my PhotoShop Elements it wasn't a total loss, but we did lose a few pix. At that point I realized this unit was dead. I wound up formatting her memory card and copying the images from PSE to the memory on a new, simpler reader/writer. Needless to say, I won't be using any trick technology on memory cards anymore. BTW, my instincts kept telling me to lock the memory card when inserting. I couldn't figure out why I would. Now I always do!</div>
      <div class="question">Vista compatible? Seems like a good thing..and most of SanDisk's newer products seem to be...but is this one Vista Compatible?</div>
      <div class="answer">Yes it is, I am using one with Vista. No drivers required. I don't know about the \"Button Application\" because I prefer to use Windows Explorer or the command-line and haven't installed it.</div>

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">11 6, 2012</div>
      <div class="reviewText">I bought the Maxell HP-20 headphone cord and adapters for living room stereo listening on a new set of HD 239 headphones. I used a tailor's measuring tape to determine the length of the cord path between my receiver and listening position, which is 13 feet (corresponding to a common 10-foot TV viewing distance). <mark>The Maxell cord is coiled, and stretches to 20 feet under tension, plus the headphone cord is four feet long.</mark> The combo is just the right length to connect without putting tension on the cord. If I drape the cord over my ottoman, it will slide down the side under its own weight and put tension on the headphones, so I run it along the floor instead. I could also put just a little weight on it to prevent this on the ottoman.While the coil adds weight and limits the practical listening distance to something less than the total outstretched length, it reaches the common length I need. The upside to the coil is that you can stretch away a bit from the listening position without taking off the headphones, plus it neatens up the cord length when not in use. Not that coiled cords are a new thing, but just wanted to address some of the disappointments in the reviews here.Comes with a nice set of adapters that click together securely. I still run into airline seat audio ports with two prongs, and this adapter set includes one of those, which is nice. This is a well-made cord and adapter set that doesn't have audiophile pretension and price. A great value.</div>
      <div class="question">sometimes i need a headphone at work plugged into my laptop, but most headsets are too short for me to then work at same time. Can i plug these into</div>
      <div class="answer">Yes - if you buy the set it comes with various jacks. I use mine with a desktop and a laptop.</div>

Unlike adding a traditional access point to your network to expand wireless coverage, the Wireless-G Range Expander does not need to be connected to the network by a data cable. Just put it within range of your main access point or wireless router, and it "bounces" the signals out to remote wireless devices.This "relay station" or "repeater" approach saves wiring costs and helps to build wireless infrastructure by driving signals into even those distant, reflective corners and hard-to-reach areas where wireless coverage is spotty and cabling is impractical. The Range Expander is perfect to help cover large areas in multi-story homes, warehouse environments, public spaces, wireless "Hot Spots", and outdoor venues -- anywhere you need extra coverage for your wireless network.The Wireless-G Range Expander is compatible with the Linksys WAP54G Access Point, and both the WRT54G and WRT54GS Wireless Routers. It works with both Wireless-G and Wireless-B clients so you'll get the benefits of increased coverage, even with a mixed network.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B00021XIJW-A30P91CPWP0T7H')" id="toggleBtn-B00021XIJW-A30P91CPWP0T7H">Show more</button>

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">11 27, 2006</div>
      <div class="reviewText">I received Version 1.0.  I think that is why it is over 58% off on Amazon.com.  Because they are selling off the version 1.0.I use an Airlink 325W router (G Router).  After talking with support rep Ramiz, badge number 50678, it seems that I have a version 1.0 Range Booster which is NOT compatible with the Airlink that I use.  His suggestion is that I return this product and find a 2.0 or 3.0.Version 1.0 will NOT say "Version 1.0" on the box.  But if it is Version 2.0 or 3.0 then it will be correctly labelled on the box.  <mark>Another way to tell you have 1.0 is that (1) your setup cd will say Ver 1.0 and (2) your Range Booster does not have an Ethernet Jack.Supposedly, with the Version 2.0 or 3.0, which has an ethernet jack, I need to connect my router to the Ethernet Jack on the Range Booster ONCE for setup purposes (so it can copy settings I believe) and then I will be able to expand my wireless network.</mark>  My brother told me that his was easy to set up and he never had to connect the ethernet jack.  I said, "wait, so you DO have an ethernet jack..." and he said, "yes, but it's under a flap, go look for it."I looked all over...no ethernet jack.  I have version 1.0.I also followed the directions of one of the reviewers, disabling WEP, going to 192.168.1.240 to access the booster...and it did not work.  I tried hard resetting the thing...nothing.Either (1) already have a Linksys Router and not the cheap stuff like me, or (2) make sure you get the 2.0 or 3.0 version.Hope that helps...</div>
      <div class="question">Does it have an ethernet port? Does the model sold by Amazon have the ethernet port?</div>
      <div class="answer">Yes, the latest version of the WRE54G sold by Amazon does have the ethernet port for wired setup. Or at least they did as of summer 2008. I do not think the older version is available any longer as a new product.</div>

      <div class="reviewTime">08 17, 2011</div>
      <div class="reviewText">I've had a pair of HD280 Pros for about four years now, and still love them. High points are good exterior noise isolation, and clear strong sound without being too punchy. They are sensitive enough to use at normal listening levels when connected to an iPod or other mobile device, but if you like to listen at very loud levels you might need to look at a headphone amp.The headphones are plastic, but seem to be pretty good quality - mine have survived numerous trips stuffed into a backpack for use on an airplane and don't really show any wear at this point. Likewise, the padding doesn't show any wear - though these days they mostly stay in a drawer at home exThe one area that will be problematic for some people is fit. They are tight. When I first got them, I would have to say they were right on the edge of being uncomfortable, perhaps a little over the line. They do loosen up a little over time, but these aren't headphones you are ever going to forget you are wearing. <mark>On the other hand, that tight fit really does provide excellent isolation - my wife can be watching TV in the same room and I won't be able to hear it while listening to music even at minimal levels; likewise, my wife can be sleeping in bed next to me while I listen with the volume cranked up and it won't disturb her (an advantage over noise cancelling and open-design headphones that people sometimes forget).</mark></div>
      <div class="question">Do these do a good job a suppressing human speech? I also want something to suppress noises that my wife makes around the house so that I can read.</div>
      <div class="answer">Yeah they do. When my coworkers talk to me I have to take them off.</div>

It was twenty dollars with free shipping.  As soon as I plugged it in it worked.  I read a good dozen floppies without any issues and was able to transfer the files I needed to my hard drive.  I do recommend this however if you are using windows 7 I'll give you a few pointers.  First off there is no install disc, simply plug into your usb and it will recognize the device.  It will show up under devices and printers so you need to go to start and click on devices and printers and then click on the USB floppy reader right click and open and it should be drive A.  You will more than likely need to do this for each floppy you put in.  <mark>It may take up to a minute to read the entire floppy it's not as quick as a standard external drive or usb stick by any means...however it will read your old floppies and if you wish you can even transfer files to it and take it with you.Bottom line, this works great you just need a little patience.</mark></div>
      <div class="question">Has anyone used this floppy drive to gain access to an XP floppy disc.--Thanks</div>
      <div class="answer">I'm not quite sure what you're asking, but I have used the drive numerous times to copy floppy disks created on Windows XP to my computer's hard drive running Windows 7. However not all XP programs will work in the Windows 7 operating system. All of the files like excel, winword, etc. created on a floppy and transferred to the 7 hard drive were usable by the programs. Hope this helps.</div>

        <p>Canon raises the stakes for professional photography with its EF 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6 DO IS USM teleph<span id="dots-B0001G6U3Y-ATXZN4ZBT7VT">...</span><span id="more-B0001G6U3Y-ATXZN4ZBT7VT" style="display:none">oto lens with image stabilization. Thanks to a new triple-layered diffractive optical element (DO), this 70-300mm lens is less than 4 inches (10 cm) long. It can focus down to 4.6 feet (without rotating the front element) and a new zoom lock button keeps the lens safe and secure when not in use or used at the wide angle. A virtually silent ultra-sonic motor (USM) gives the lens extremely fast autofocus. The lens also includes Canon's Image Stabilization technology to dramatically reduce camera shake, compensating for approximately three stops in shutter speed without any perceptible increase in image blur. It's a great choice for professional photojournalists and serious advanced amateurs who need to contain the size and weight of equipment carried.DO ElementsUse of the new three-layer DO lens drastically reduces the overall length and weight of the lens system increasing the refractive power of each lens element and reducing the spaces between elements. It's approximately 26 percent shorter and 36 percent lighter than any lens of comparable specifications.Zoom lockThe EF 70-300mm lens features a zoom ring locking mechanism, locking the lens at its shortest total length. This helps to protect the lens from potential damage by preventing the zoom elements extending under their own weight, which might otherwise occur when the lens is mounted to a camera that hangs from a neck or shoulder strap.Image StabilizationThe lens incorporates Canon's Image Stabilization (IS) technology, compensating for approximately three stops without any perceptible increase in image blur when shooting static subjects or panning. This increases the range of circumstances in which hand-held photography is possible, limiting the need to carry a tripod.Fast AFA rear focusing ring type USM, high-speed CPU and new AF algorithms combine to give the lens extremely fast auto-focusing. The ring-type ultrasonic motor (USM) converts ultrasonic vibrational energy into rotational force to deliver high-speed, high-precision, super efficient and virtually noiseless auto focusing, with good holding torque for rapid response and accurate stopping. Full-time manual override is featured, removing the possibility of damage to the autofocus mechanism during manual focus. The lens has a minimum focusing distance of just 1.4m throughout the entire zoom range.Ready for Digital PhotographyThe lens shape and coatings have been optimized to suppress ghosting and flaring, making this lens ideal for use with digital cameras that are more susceptible to reflections off the recording media than are film cameras.Working with EOSThe drive pattern of the lens is tailored to specifically match that of the latest EOS range, extracting maximum benefit from the lens' speed advantage. The lens comes with a case LP1116 and an exclusive hood ET-65B for shading against unwanted direct light.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B0001G6U3Y-ATXZN4ZBT7VT')" id="toggleBtn-B0001G6U3Y-ATXZN4ZBT7VT">Show more</button>

      <div class="reviewText">Since I use a Canon Rebel with a 1.6x crop this lens becomes (in effect) like a 112mm - 480mm zoom.  I considered the "standard" 70-300mm IS zoom and the 100-400 IS-L zoom and selected this because of it's size and weight.  The DO has not been an issue and the pictures are sharp and clear.  <mark>I did discover that the Canon 1.4x extender does not work with this lens and neither does the 2x glass I bought for the front.I have been especially surprised (and pleased) at the macro possibilities.</mark>  A butterfly at four feet nearly fills the frame!Another 100mm would be nice, but this lens fits nicely with my 17-85mm IS to give me a nice complete range for field trips.</div>
      <div class="question">Is the 1.4x range extender compatible with this lense?</div>
      <div class="answer">I haven't tried it with an extender, but I don't think it's compatible. This information comes from Canon: \"This converter is only compatible with fixed focal length L-series lenses 135mm and over, as well as the EF 70-200/2.8L, EF 70-200/2.8L IS, EF 70-200/4L, and EF 100-400/4.5-5.6L.\"</div>

      <div class="reviewText">These are absolutely great binoculars you can focus on items a close a 7 ft or so. Very clear sight picture. <mark>I have poor eye sight and use them to see smaller print on the television as well as some football and basketball.</mark> A tad heavy but not bad and they more than make up for it in usability.</div>
      <div class="question">Work ok for basketball and football games</div>
      <div class="answer">The small field of view might make it frustrating for sporting events- this is true of all compact binoculars. If you don't mind carrying something bigger, a 7 x 35 or 8 x 42 pair would work better for sports. But if you really want something small that fits in your coat pocket, these would be fine.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">These boxes are wonderful! <mark>They are the perfect size for storing DVDs and CDs in their cases.</mark> They are very nice looking and very sturdy. But I also use them for storing other things that I don't want to see, like extra cords, cables and headsets. I will definitely be ordering more of them. They also stack nicely.</div>
      <div class="question">Would this item accomodate a side for DVDs in slim packs and CDs in single sleeves in the other side?</div>

        <p>The Palm IIIxe handheld builds on earlier Palm III models by offering more memory and more options. <span id="dots-B00004RC2D-A173G0GN4479RG">...</span><span id="more-B00004RC2D-A173G0GN4479RG" style="display:none">Its 8 MB of RAM (four times the memory of the popular Palm IIIe) and 2 MB of flash ROM keep track of all your appointments, memos, to-do items, expense items, and e-mail, plus you can add thousands of third-party applications. Although the Palm IIIe and IIIx models have ample memory for many users, the Palm IIIxe better supports users who rely upon their organizer for data-heavy operations.The Palm IIIxe is more powerful than its predecessors, but it retains all of the Palm IIIx's and IIIe's convenience features. It measures a mere 4.7 by 3.2 by 0.7 inches and weighs 6 ounces. Backing up and exchanging information with desktop PCs and popular PIMs requires just a touch of a button on the included HotSync cradle. The infrared port allows you to instantly beam business card information, phone lists, data, and applications to other infrared-equipped devices. It also features a sharp backlit LCD screen, legible in both dim and bright light.The contents of the Palm IIIxe box include the Palm IIIxe handheld, a CD-ROM with an extensive assortment of Palm Desktop software applications, two AAA batteries, a DB-25 adapter, a HotSync cradle, a manual, and a Getting Started quick guide. You may further customize your Palm IIIxe organizer with third-party add-on peripherals such as modems or voice recorders. This device runs for approximately two months on just two AAA batteries and comes with a one-year manufacturer's warranty.What's in the boxPalm IIIxeProtective flip coverStylusPalm Desktop software2 AAA batteriesDB-25 adapterHotSync cradleManualGetting Started guide</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B00004RC2D-A173G0GN4479RG')" id="toggleBtn-B00004RC2D-A173G0GN4479RG">Show more</button>

      <div class="reviewTime">03 28, 2001</div>
      <div class="reviewText">I have owned the Palm IIIxe for a little over a month now, and I must admit that I love this thing.The battery life is excellent (I am still at about half life on my original set of batteries).  I can see the screen great in bright light or pitch dark (thanks to the backlight.)  The 8MB of ram is more than adequate to download additional programs and games through Avantgo.com, Palmgear.com and Tucows.com. (I presently have 25 additional programs downloaded on mine.)The IIIxe is also fairly rugged.  I have dropped this thing 3 or 4 times now, and it doesnt have a scratch on it, and works great.For the price, you can not find a better PDA on the market than the Palm IIIxe.  <mark>It will help you organize your life, and its handy alarm will always remind you of those meetings and appointments that you set two or three weeks ago that slipped your mind.</mark>  It is also great for checking your email on the fly.Throw away your bulky Franklin Planner, and slip the Palm IIIxe in your pocket today.  You will be glad that you did.Highly recommended!!</div>
      <div class="question">does the organizer have an alarm</div>
      <div class="answer">Yes it does. You can also refer to this .pdf for the device. http://pdf.textfiles.com/manuals/PDA/PalmOne%20III%20Handheld.pdf</div>

Also, great for airplane travel I was able to take my own free, sanitary, (for my ears only) headphones for the movie, and be prepared for either size plug. The adapter is pocket size, convenient and inexpensive. I can afford to buy several, leave one at home.

        <span class="summary">Great little radio in the car...GET an ANTENNA</span>
      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">02 3, 2014</div>
      <div class="reviewText">Got this just to mess around with in my car.  I used to have a full size mounted CB in a truck and it was always fun.I used this for a day or two with batteries and the rubber duck antenna that comes with it.  <mark>For playing inside, or around the house, that's fine.I put it in my car with the adapter kit and quickly realized I wasn't going to get service from inside (duh).Stopped off and bought a little magnet mount antenna, and BAM, I had signal.With a cheap 14&#34; antenna I added, I tested it in a fairly open area with a trucker...We were talking clearly for about a six mile range.</mark>  I'm happy with it for the price point.Obviously there's bigger and better out there, but they're also more expensive, and usually not handheld.I love how compact this is.  And the fact that if I want to put it in a different vehicle, all I have to do is unplug it and move it over.</div>
      <div class="question">So with the adapter, you can plug the radio into something and it will use your car antenna or some other antenna and get further range? How far?</div>
      <div class="answer">Range depends on the CB antenna used, and location. With just 5 watts, you could get 5miles if you were on the flatlands, or a desert. Out on the countryside maybe 3miles. In the city about a mile, maybe. If you use it inside the car with just the rubber duck antenna supplied, virtually nothing. You need a CB antenna mounted on the roof of your car. Cobra has a 36\" magnet mount CB antenna that works very well. Model HG A1500. In addition, you can use a linear amplifier to increase range (though it's illegal, it's commonly used) An RM KL-30 would increase your output to about 30watts, this increasing the range. Good luck.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">This unit was pretty easy to install: I used a Dash Kit: Metra 99-3002 (when installed I didn't need to file the dash trim as the installation instructions suggested, fit fine right over the top without filing at all), I used a Wiring Harness Metra 70-1858, Metra 40-GM10 GM Antenna Adapter. I ran the mic boom down the inside door trim and under the dash ended up with no wire showing at all. Tested the bluetooth with my Galaxy S3 and worked perfectly with great phone quality.  <mark>I also tested the bluetooth music playing from my Galaxy S3 and it worked great as well.One little issue on install was that the right rear speaker did not work at first.</mark> I did some trouble shooting and found that the 2 purple wires were swapped on the XDMA6415 wiring harness (Factory mistake). I swapped the 2 wires and it worked fine. Overall I am very pleased!</div>
      <div class="question">can you play music (pandora) using the bluetooth?</div>
      <div class="answer">I think so, right up until the unit fails and drains your battery. Having had two of these fail in the same exact way I can't imagine why anyone would waste any money on this POS</div>

It offers the highest quality outside of digital and is a good choice for everyday shooting. As long as you just want to document your family's life, and send videos to grandma, you aren't really giving anything up.The CCD-TRV608 is Sony's flagship Hi8 camcorder, and it offers an assortment of features that make it great for the average home videographer. Sporting a 3-inch color LCD and 20x optical zoom, there's really no situation that the TRV608 won't shoot well. Especially when you add in the NightShot mode, which switches the camera to an infrared shooting mode, and SteadyShot image stabilization, which helps eliminate those annoying shakes that accompany high zoom levels.In addition to a few fader and picture effects, as well as some titling options, the CCD-TRV608 offers a unique USB streaming mode. Essentially, you connect your camcorder to a PC via USB, and with the addition of some provide software, you can stream live audio and video from the camcorder, capture stills, and playback recorded video scenes.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B0000630MM-A3UINLBACQ5DV4')" id="toggleBtn-B0000630MM-A3UINLBACQ5DV4">Show more</button>

        <p>Celestron's value priced PowerSeeker 60 is an affordable entry level telescope with some nice extras<span id="dots-B0002CTZAC-AHEZM0HOAOWZ3">...</span><span id="more-B0002CTZAC-AHEZM0HOAOWZ3" style="display:none"> like a correct image prism and "The Sky" astronomy software included. The package also includes an Alt-Azimuth mount with adjustable aluminum tripod, high and low power eyepieces, a 3X barlow lens, and a 5 power cross hair finder scope.The PowerSeeker 60AZ comes disassembled in a compact box, but the fully illustrated quick set-up guide makes it easy to assemble. Go ahead and try it out in the daytime, that's the best time to align the finder scope while looking at a distant tree or telephone pole.The optics of the PowerSeeker 60AZ are surprisingly good, especially when I use the low power 20mm eyepiece. The correct image prism and the 20mm eyepiece give me a magnification of 35X, so backyard birds seem five times closer than with my seven power binoculars. My first view of Saturn's rings and globular cluster M13 in the constellation Hercules came with a 60mm telescope similar to the PowerSeeker 60, and the new PowerSeeker 60AZ is just as good showing me literally hundreds of craters on the Moon.The PowerSeeker 60 can be upgraded with standard 1.25 inch telescope eyepieces. A 25mm plossl eyepiece for example gives a true field of view of almost 2 degrees for delightful views of star clusters like the Pleiades, while a 6mm eyepiece provides a magnification of 117X, just right to see the rings of Saturn or the cloud bands on Jupiter. The Alt-Azimuth mount included with the PowerSeeker 60AZ is lighter and easier to use than an Equatorial mount, but it does not track stars and planets. As soon as you get the Moon centered in the eyepiece it starts drifting toward the edge, this is caused by rotation of the Earth. The Moon may stay in the low power eyepiece for two or three minutes, but with the high power 4mm eyepiece (175X magnification) a star will disappear in only twenty or thirty seconds.Celestron's PowerSeeker 60AZ is a real value because it has surprisingly good optics in a package that's light, portable and affordable. The drawback is that it has a lot of plastic parts, including the finder scope and the 3X barlow. For a more rugged alternative, take a look at Celestron's AstroMaster 70AZ which has more powerful optics, better eyepieces, and a much sturdier Alt-Azimuth mount. --Jeff PhillipsPros:Surprisingly good opticsCorrect image prismEasy no tool set-upLight, portable, and affordableCons:Does not track stars and planetsPlastic finder and barlow lensLight weight tripod</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B0002CTZAC-AHEZM0HOAOWZ3')" id="toggleBtn-B0002CTZAC-AHEZM0HOAOWZ3">Show more</button>

      <div class="reviewText">I'm very picky when it comes to memory cards for either my camera and/or phone. I usually try to get the biggest GB I could get and the best. So far I have been looking for a GB MicroSD card for my phone. After hearing lots of reviews but also problems from the other SanDisk 32GB how it caused some problems for others who had the Galaxy s4 and it erased memory/data, but worked for a lot. I didn't want to take the risk of losing data or pictures/music on my phone by getting the 32 GB. Maybe the 32GB didn't work for some because they already had data and pics on it already or the GB was too big to handle.After hearing a lot of good reviews from the Professional Ultra SanDisk 16GB also, I prayed that this memory chip work for my phone. <mark>Sure it wasn't a 32GB, but it was big enough to hold more pictures and apps on it.</mark> And it worked for my phone!I was getting nervous hoping not to get a format pop-up sign when I inserted the chip, but Thank God it didn't and the memory card gave me no problems whatsoever.  :)</div>

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">10 21, 2010</div>
      <div class="reviewText">I have been through about 6 headphones, trying to find the right ones to use at work.  I tried the wired Senheisser cans, but they were too uncomfortable for extended use.  Then tried some wireless Senheissers, but they had too much interference from all the nearby electronics.  Earbuds were ok, but they are a pain to have to remove and re-insert everytime a co-worker came up to talk or my phone rang.  Same for In-ear (my preferred solution for listening while not at work), which left me too oblivious to what's going on around me.Finally, I decided to try what looked like the most comfortable solution. I was willing to trade sound quality for comfort, but guess what, I don't have to.  These little headphones have amazing sound!  They are perfect.  Lightweight, extremely comfortable, and they have have a wonderful sound quality.  Bass?  Plenty enough.  <mark>Even better, I can turn up the volume to a very comfortable listening level without worrying about too much sound "bleeding" out and disturbing my next door cube neighbor.The cord length is nearly perfect too.</mark>  Long enough to stay plugged in and no jerks when reaching around for stuff on my desk.And when someone walks up to talk to me, I can drop them down around my neck.  For &lt; $5, this set is everything you need for comfortable, extended listening.</div>

      <div class="question">does this work with mic to camcorder?</div>
      <div class="answer">While I have not personally tried this -- based on a fundamental working knowledge of electronics and personal experience with audio equipment, it should theoretically work. I would suggest, however, that you check the specifications of both the microphone and the camcorder you will be plugging it into, if possible. Often times, microphones with a 1/4\" jack will have a lower impedance or output gain, as they are designed to be plugged in to higher end equipment with a separate pre-amplication unit, while microphones with a 3.5mm headphone jack have a higher gain to compensate for the lack of preamplification in the consumer level device they will be plugged into, such as a laptop. If the microphone output is lower than that which the camcorder requires, the recording may be low or inaudible. If the microphone output level is too high, it could come out distorted or even potentially damage your equipment--though this is unlikely. I would definitely double check on that. Somebody more experienced than myself could probably provide a more educated answer, but they haven't, so I hope this helps.</div>

      <div class="reviewTime">02 23, 2013</div>
      <div class="reviewText">Well I bought a used APC BR1500LCD from Ebay but it had no data cable.On the product manual the APC to PC outlet is described as an RJ45 socket, which it is not. It is a 10 pin RJ50. <mark>The sole purpose of using an obscure network cable to supply a USB feed seems to be to prevent you from using anything but APCs proprietary cable.I had resigned myself to making up special cable when I found a link to this item.I loaded the Powerchute PC software today and this cable works perfectly.Teach APC a lesson and buy this cable.You could take the back off the APC and wire a USB socket directly to the board, but for less than $10 just buy this cable.</mark></div>
      <div class="question">Will this cable work with a USB hub, or does it need to be connected directly to the PC from the APC?</div>
      <div class="answer">I would recommend a straight connection. However it does depend on what else is on the usb hub. if you have a hard drive or anything that requires more attention from the hub. I would recommend definitely not.</div>

      <div class="description">
        <p>As digital imaging continues to make inroads into the world of professional photography, Nikon's rel<span id="dots-B00006JK37-A18DON5KI1ERFX">...</span><span id="more-B00006JK37-A18DON5KI1ERFX" style="display:none">ease of the D100 proves that far from being a flash in the pan, digital SLRs really can make a valuable contribution.Styled around the more traditional N80, the D100 has a full-featured body, is nicely weighted and considerably lighter than you might expect, given the amount of technology that's packed into it. The controls are nicely situated, and navigating through the settings using the provided four-way movement pad becomes second nature very quickly. Picture preview comes courtesy of the built-in 1.8-inch LCD screen, which allows for a cursory check of any pictures taken. Unlike earlier Nikon products, it's not possible to use the screen on the D100 as an alternate viewfinder, restricting its use in tight situations, but the results through the "traditional" viewfinder are perfectly adequate.As you would expect from a 6-megapixel camera, the image quality is superb at all levels, from the highest resolution (a mighty 3,008 x 2,000 pixels) down to a less intense 1,504 x 1,000 pixels. At any resolution, the output images are really very good, color saturation is well up to par, and overall the results stand up well. On the downside, perfectionists may well find there's a tiny amount less definition, but there's nothing here to raise anything approaching serious issues.Power is provided from a supplied rechargeable battery pack, which is both light and long lasting--up to a maximum of two hours, depending on flash usage. To recharge from empty takes around two hours, so it would be worth investing in a second pack. The D100 takes Type I and II CompactFlash as well as Microdrive units, which are invaluable for users looking to take any more than a handful of pictures in a single session. Our tests showed a 256 MB CF card could handle around 40 high-resolution uncompressed TIFF images, suddenly making a 1 GB Microdrive look extremely attractive.The built-in flash unit, which pops up above the lens, is powerful and efficient, proving effective in a variety of conditions. Unlike many digital cameras, it only fires a single flash, effectively reducing red-eye without sacrificing performance.It's difficult not to be impressed by the D100. It's a stylish and good-looking camera that proves that beauty isn't just skin deep by providing results well above expectation. The inclusion of the fast-charge battery pack means downtime is kept to a minimum, and the software packages provided by Nikon (including NikonView 5) make it easy to manipulate your images and save them out to hard drive, CD, or DVD. This is not a cheap buy, especially when you consider the base price excludes any form of lens, but for those with deep pockets the D100 is a force to be reckoned with.--Elly RussellPros:Superb image quality--up to 3,008 x 2,000 pixelsNicely weighted, full-featured bodyCompatible with MicrodrivesCons:Noticed a bit less definition to images</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B00006JK37-A18DON5KI1ERFX')" id="toggleBtn-B00006JK37-A18DON5KI1ERFX">Show more</button>

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">08 23, 2004</div>
      <div class="reviewText">I've always been an avid Nikon user. And from now on I'm even more than ever!I haven&#8217;t been able to put it down since buying it in July, 2004.The picture quality & clarity is amazing, as if you&#8217;re actually  there in the photo!I&#8217;ve flown front seat in a helicopter this summer and took some great arial photos! "National Geographic Magazine" here I come!!!This baby has a lot of great functions!The quick speed of the playback monitor & deletion of unwanted photos are must-have functions! It's nice to have only good photos, rather than over-exposed trash. I&#8217;ve been able to take so many photos with this thing, I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;ll be doing with my F90X and the rest of my other film cameras. There&#8217;s no end to the imagination with the D100. With my F90X, the colors and effects are lost during the development of the film and the printing of the photo. Having the D100, I&#8217;ll have less worry over my photo&#8217;s results.During my partner's 25-day business trip, he only shot about 362 photos out of 598 & only recharged the battery once. Spares come in handy, that's for sure! I have a 20-35mm. f/2.8D Zoom lens. <mark>I used that baby left and right with the F90X and it seems to be the perfect lens for the D100 (FYI&#8230;this lens is discontinued and has been replaced by a 17-35 f/2.8D).Our D100 is loaded with a 1Gb memory card that gives me 598 frames configured as jpeg normal, large (3,008 X 2,000) Pixels.Battery life is excellent.</mark> We don&#8217;t have to change the battery all that much, and when we do, it recharges quite promptly. If you don&#8217;t play with the monitor frequently you should be able to take about 1600 shots on 1 battery.Obviously, frequent use of the Monitor takes up a lot of battery juice. I try not to use the monitor much because of just that. Owning this Baby is fantastic, because it&#8217;s saving us a bundle of money on film & reprints.If our friends ask for a copy of a photo/s, we just email them out and it&#8217;s done! No more waiting on Friday afternoons at the photo lab!Some Good Technical Points about the D100:- Dynamic-Area AF (Auto Focus): Useful when you have an erratically moving subject. The focus will readjust itself.- You can adjust the ISO sensitivity from 200 to 1600 and HI-1 and HI-2.  Trust me, it works great with proper use!- White Balance: (the color of light reflected from any object). The white balance makes sure that whites are whites in any given situation instead of coming out a shade of gray.- AF-Assist Eliminator: It helps the camera Auto-focus on a poorly lit subject by sending a beam of light on the subject to help the focussing process.- Memory Buffer: is extremely quick for fast, consecutive shots.- Comfortable to hold in right hand- Fairly Light, depending on the lens used- You can input comments on the monitor, with the keyboard area, to the comment area and attach it to your picture.- All Nikkor lenses are compatible with the D100, depending on the nature of the lens. Some minor adjustments or compensations or different settings may need to occur. (out of focus or manual lens, AF-S, AF-I Nikkor lenses etc&#8230;)- True to life color photosPhoto Manipulation:Each photo, when uploaded to the computer is about 1.5Mb in size.With the use of Photoshop, I usually have to make only minor adjustments to the levels, depending on what needs to be enhanced. With the D100, I&#8217;ve tried taking photos indoors without the flash, but it doesn&#8217;t guarantee clarity unless you crank up the ISO sensitivity, and use the noise reducer. You may find yourself needing to use the flash indoors, more often, because it will most likely result in a blurred or distorted photo. With the D100, I'm able to capture indoor images I've only dreamt of, and didn't need to use slow speeds and a tripod.Our first Nikon was the F1 standard model with a Photomic Head, in 1969. I've had many disappointments with my non-digital Nikon models because of multiple visits to the repairman, resulting in the carbon track in the Photometer being worn out & couldn't be replaced. That would explain why all my photos were always over-exposed. I&#8217;ve always had wrong readings.My partner&#8217;s decision to switch to digital was one of his greatest purchases within the past year, among other things! I suggest you invest in this camera because you won&#8217;t be sorry!</div>
      <div class="question">does this camera have a memory card</div>
      <div class="answer">Yes, it's granddaughters and she is happy with it I got it for her for Christmas a couple years ago-sorry it took a while to answer, I had to get ahold of her</div>

      <div class="reviewText">I was gonna give this rating 4 stars instead of 5 stars only because the remote doesn't work.  I don't know if it's the battery in the remote or if it's the remote itself.  Will be contacting the proper parties when I change the battery.Then I was gonna give it 3 stars instead of 4 because the dials were acting weird, but I simply hit the very small reset button on the unit to get it to act normal again.Now this unit looks AMAZINGLY cool!  It has a motorized faceplate which has an optional detachable feature.  The picture shown on this site doesn't do it much justice.  The blue lights are much cooler, cleaner, and deeper, ESPECIALLY at night. And when the unit is off the knob turns red giving off a nice Red Halo.Before I hooked my system up I had factory speakers in the car.  This radio brought them to LIFE!  I was shocked at how clean and clear the music became after changing the factory unit and putting in this one.I don't use many of the features, but I am pleased, very, very pleased with this unit.  I've recieved many compliments on how nice it looks and how cool it is.... and I blow them away when I tell them I much I paid.I don't use the radio (am/fm) unless I'm checking up on my Browns so the radio feature doesn't get any play at all right now, but it works clean and fine and picks up my stations pretty well (I'm in Cleveland). <mark>I have tried using the bluetooth feature to stream music from my Android device and it worked perfectly.I don't use CDs anymore, but I burned 2 just to test the quality of the unit.</mark>  One was a MP3 disc, and the other was a copy of Disc 1 of Life After Death Disc by Notorious B.I.G.  Each worked perfectly fine.  So whenever I need to use a CD I know I can use one.I use the auxiliary jack input (AUX)to connect my iPod and it works flawlessly with pure, clean, crisp quality.  I truly bought this device for three things and three things only "PRICE, LOOKS, and AUX INPUT", but there are a ton of features on here that I don't even use.  But I love options, and this has plenty of them.  There are a few EQ settings that work nice, fade settings that work well, and the interface is EXTREMELY SIMPLE and intuitive.There is a regular RCA jack input in the back for loudspeakers (or whatever) and there is a subwoofer RCA jack input for Subs.  I have my 3000 watt max (2100RMS @1-ohm) Planet Audio Anarchy Amplifier Class D Monoblock Amp hooked up to this, and three subs hooked up to that, and this thing is perfect for me.It fits my style (ballin' on a budget lol), it looks nice, and it works like it should.Like I said.... I would have given it 5 stars, but I have to see whats with the remote first.... if it's the battery and not the remote then I'll update, but even then I might not change the review stars, because that shouldn't have been an issue in the first place.It deserves 5 stars tho'... it truly does. (but that remote was very important and it isn't working right now)</div>

      <div class="reviewText">It's a pretty simple system that does just what it says. <mark>The channels in which the wires sit are adequate for maybe 3 to 5 wires, depending on what type they are, and seem fairly durable.</mark> The elbow connectors seems less durable and like they maybe liable to pop off if place somewhere where they may get bumped (not a problem for me). My primary complaint is that the assortment of connectors may be insufficient for many applications if you're trying to navigate around a series of corners. I wasn't able to take the path I preferred on account of the limited connector options (I could have used more of one type of connector and none of the others). But I knew what I was getting when I ordered it.And a suggestion re: the adhesive backing: Some reviewers have claimed that it is very difficult to remove should you ever desire to do so. I can see how this would be the case. The peel-and-stick adhesive certainly looks as if it's intended to be permanent, which is probably a good thing. Since I may want to remove my Wiremold in a few years and don't relish the idea of scraping several feet of adhesive off my wall, I opted to score the adhesive a couple times every foot or two, so that I could remove only a one- or two-inch piece of the backing. Most wires aren't that heavy, and a four foot run of this probably doesn't need four feet of adhesive to support it (especially when it's placed vertically). So only exposing an inch or two of adhesive every foot or two will hopefully save me trouble down the road and should be plenty secure in the meantime.</div>
      <div class="question">will 4 camera wires fit in here</div>
      <div class="answer">They will; but it would be kind of a tight fit.</div>

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">07 7, 2014</div>
      <div class="reviewText">I purchased two Monster Cable MPS850 power centers for our electronics last year. Recently the service neutral power line was broken in a storm. The resulting power surge (208 volts to be precise) fried several of our electronic items connected to these power strips. We had other sensitive electronics (including a laptop and a pair of Samsung tablets) plugged into cheaper, competing brand surge protectors. Nothing else was damaged.I wasn't too worried about this because of Monster's $150,000 protection guarantee. That was a mistake. After calling and speaking with a friendly customer service agent, Rodrigo Chavez, I was instructed to email a copy of the invoice where I purchased the power centers. That took a while due to various electronics being fried, but I did do so about a week later.  <mark>Mr. Arturo Castro responded quickly with this:&#34;Thank You for the receipt, unfortunately the store factory depot is not listed as an authorized dealer, we won&#8217;t be able to proceed with your warranty claim.You case is canceled.We are sorry for the inconvenience.&#34;Now, no where in the ad for this on Amazon.com did they mention that only certain dealers could be used for this warranty to be valid.</mark> These were purchased new. The last human being to touch them was someone who worked for Monster. Luckily for me, I live in a country where lies told by corporations are excused by lawyers who politely twist anything to the profit of their corporate masters.But, they do feel really bad about it as they take my money and run. Their hearts are heavy with regret because they are &#34;sorry for the inconvenience.&#34;</div>
      <div class="question">Is the Monster factory warranty valid if I purchase from you? Monster states seller must be authorized dealer for warranty validation.</div>
      <div class="answer">i believe if the warranty was good thru amazon, then amazon would have said so instead of sending your question to me.</div>

      <div class="reviewTime">01 11, 2014</div>
      <div class="reviewText">Despite a lot of positive reviews for this product, I found it to be worthless. Even the manufacturer says this device WILL NOT yield a steady voltage. My standby generator voltage is 125 +/- 2 vac. Voltage out of this unit when supplied by my generator was 125 +/- 2 vac when set on 120 or 127 volt output. <mark>When set to 110v output, output was 110 +/- 2 volts.</mark> In all cases, my UPS toggled between battery and line voltage which has already baked one PC power supply. BTW, I disassembled this POS and it contains NO battery. Not only would I not recommend this product, I would run for the hills before wasting any money on this.</div>
      <div class="question">On my device I am getting fluctuating values between 105-106v on the 110v setting. Is this roughly what others are experiencing while it's regulating?</div>
      <div class="answer">Mine has been rock solid at 110v. My source voltage varies between 121v and 128v so correction is always on. Sounds like you may suffer from a low voltage source, which if you're set at 110v the device would not compensate for since that variation is below it's threshold. Have you tried setting to 120v and seen if it brings that voltage up to a stable value? too much load could also be an issue....</div>

        <p>The perfect EOS for advanced-amateurs and professionals alike, the EOS 20D sets new standards in its<span id="dots-B0002XQI2E-A3V782H65DR6V1">...</span><span id="more-B0002XQI2E-A3V782H65DR6V1" style="display:none"> class. Featuring an all-new 8.2 MP CMOS Sensor, a second generation DIGIC II Image Processor, 5 fps performance for up to 23 consecutive frames and a 0.2 second start-up time, the EOS 20D is designed to capture richly detailed, perfectly exposed images with speed formerly found only in cameras several times the price. Other features include a top shutter speed of 1/8000 sec., flash sync at 1/250, a new high-precision 9-point AF System, a built-in multi-controller for fast focusing point selection and a refined magnesium alloy body, for rugged, go anywhere photography. Compatible with not only Canon's new EF-S Lenses, but with the entire EOS System of lenses and flashes, the EOS 20D is a professionally featured camera with a consumer price tag.8.2 Megapixel CMOS SensorCanon's all-new large area CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) Sensor captures images with exceptional clarity and tonal range, and offers the most pixels in its class. This 2nd generation APS-C size sensor (22.5 x 15.0mm) has the same 3:2 ratio as film cameras, enabling an effective angle of view that is 1.6x the normal EF Lens focal length. The EOS 20D has an extensive ISO range (from 100 to 1600 plus ISO 3200 in extended mode),and the sensor features a newly developed set of narrow-gap microlenses and noise reduction circuits to improve performance at high ISOs, and optimized photodiode configurations for improved performance at all ISOs. This results in larger, clearer, sharper and more detailed photographs right from the start.Second Generation DIGIC II Image ProcessorThe EOS 20D benefits from Canon's in-house development: The DIGIC II Image Processor was developed originally for the EOS-1D Mark II and enhances every aspect of image capture. Information captured by the CMOS Sensor is processed and assembled into images of exceptional quality by this new Image Processor. With the DIGIC II Image Processor on board, photographers can expect precise, natural colors, and spot-on white balance in any number of lighting situations. Through sophisticated signal processing algorithms, the DIGIC II Image Processor even accelerates all aspects of image capture, while consuming less energy than other processors.Every Function Optimized for Speedy RAW and JPEG CaptureThe EOS 20D has been designed to capture images with speeds that had been reserved for professional level cameras. Whether it's the 0.2 second start-up time, the high speed mirror drive, the class-leading 65 msec. shutter release lag time, or the predictive AF focusing at speeds up to 5 frames-per-second, the EOS 20D will amaze and delight photographers who don't want to wait for their camera when they're ready to shoot. The 20D's CMOS Sensor allows 4-channel high-speed data readout, and the DIGIC II Image Processor processes the data quickly, writing files to the CompactFlash card faster, and allowing continuous shooting for up to 23 frames (JPEG Large/Fine) with significant reductions in buffer clearing times.JPEG or Simultaneous RAW+JPEGWhenever you shoot the EOS 20D, you can choose to have it record RAWs or JPEGs alone, or in RAW plus JPEG formats simultaneously. The JPEG recording format is ideal for purposes such as Internet image transfers that require reduced file sizes. Canon's proprietary RAW (.CR2) format, on the other hand, employs lossless compression to ensure the highest possible image quality, and is recorded at 12-bits per pixel to provide a wider range of tones and superior detail in bright highlights and deep shadows when compared with JPEG files. RAW files must be "processed" before they can be opened in your computer's image-editing software. This conversion process typically takes only a few seconds using the dedicated driver software, which will convert the RAW file into a standard 8-bit per channel JPEG or TIFF file, or for maximum tonal range, a 16-bit TIFF. There are six selectable settings for in-camera JPEG image quality, when CF card space is at a premium.Expansive Sensor Array for Easier CompositionThe EOS 20D has a newly developed high-precision 9-point AF system for speedy and accurate focusing in any situation. An improved focusing screen with precision matte finish enables brighter and easier manual focus. A newly developed multi-controller, conveniently located on the back of the camera for thumb-controlled action, allows the photographer to instantly choose any of the 9 focus points, or direct the camera to choose them automatically. Focusing points are positioned in the viewfinder in a wide diamond-shaped array, allowing the user to achieve focus quickly in numerous compositions and situations.Features formerly offered only in Canon's Pro Cameras allow for more fine-tuningPhotographers will find their options for color settings greatly expanded in the new EOS 20D. Taken directly from the EOS-1D Mark II, the White Balance compensation function utilizes the new multi-controller and a nifty LCD monitor display to tune any white balance setting up to +/- 9 steps in blue, amber, magenta or green hues to ensure spot-on color. The new White Balance bracketing feature produces a series of 3 files varying white balance from magenta to green or blue to amber, depending on the lighting situation.Images can be processed directly for the industry print standard Adobe RGB or standard sRGB, and are compatible with DCF 2.0 and Exif 2.21 standards for greater flexibility. A range of in-camera image processing parameters can optimize JPEG files for direct printing or post processing, or can be customized to the user's tastes and needs.The EOS 20D also features a built-in monochrome mode, a first in Canon Digital SLRs, which uses digital processing to re-create the effects of a number of different black and white filters and toning effects. These features help to take the guesswork out of black-and-white photography, reducing the need for post processing by delivering the desired detail and contrast of a black and white image from the start.Strength and Elegance CombinedThe EOS 20D feels solid and rugged in your hands ensuring stable, easy handling. Its rigid chassis combines engineering plastic with stainless steel and is covered by strong, lightweight magnesium alloy panels on the top, front and rear. Controls are ergonomically shaped and positioned to sustain the EOS tradition of ergonomic excellence and sure-fire operation. The newly designed grip, shutter button and rubber skin contribute to this excellent holding comfort, and the camera's high-profile built-in flash is compact and hides itself neatly into the top of the body. A newly refined finish adds to the elegance of the camera body.Expanded Zoom Display During PlaybackWhile viewing recorded images on the camera's 1.8-inch, high-definition TFT color LCD, you can enter the Enlargement Mode and enlarge them up to 10x in 15 stops for detailed analysis of lighting, composition, camera movement, focusing accuracy, facial expression, etc. The new multi-controller enables horizontal and vertical scrolling, while the main dial enables viewing of the previous or next image stored in the CF card at the same enlarged view. In the maximum reduced view, nine images are displayed simultaneously on the approximately screen, making them quicker to find. The camera can be set to automatically rotate vertical images so they can be viewed easily on the monitor and also after downloading to your computer.Direct Printing with PictBridge Compatible PrintersThe EOS 20D lets you print beautiful photos with minimum time and effort - directly from the camera. Simply connect the camera with any PictBridge compatible printer via the high-speed USB 2.0 port to print images stored in the CF card. You can even set the EOS 20D to trim the image, add a surrounding "frame," superimpose a date, or print a number of copies. The EOS 20D's direct printing feature complies with Exif v2.2 (Exif Print) and DPOF v1.1. With a host of portable and home printers available from Canon including the new PIXMA iP4000 and PIXMA iP3000 Photo Printers, getting tangible results from the camera has never been faster or easier.SoftwareThe EOS 20D comes bundled with three software CDs, Canon's Digital Photo Professional (Version 1.1), the EOS Solution Disk (Version 8.0), and Photoshop Elements 2.0. Each application is designed to optimize captured images, and streamline the digital workflow.EF & EF-S LensesThe EOS 20D is compatible with all Canon lenses in the EF lineup, ranging from ultra-wide-angle to super-telephoto lenses, and including Canon's new EF-S series lenses, manufactured specifically for the 20D and Digital Rebel. The EF lineup employs advanced optical know-how and micron precision engineering to deliver unprecedented performance in all facets of the photographic process. Aspherical optics and Fluorite elements, for example, are featured in the universally acclaimed L-series Lenses. Canon's Image Stabilization feature minimizes the effect of camera shake. Through Canon's EF Lenses, photographers can truly maximize the quality and liberating performance of the EOS 20D.Flash PhotographyThe EOS 20D features the acclaimed E-TTL II flash metering system introduced with the EOS-1D Mark II. Whether using its flush mounted integral flash (guide no. of 43/13 @ ISO 100 m/ft.) or any of the flashes in the EX Speedlite line, E-TTL II provides stable flash brightness through numerous exposures.Additional AccessoriesIn addition to Canon's EF series of lenses and Speedlites, several other accessories are designed to work specifically with the EOS 20D. The Battery Grip BG-E2 adds a vertical shutter release, and is compatible with up to two of Canon's BP-511/511A/512/514 Lithium-ion battery packs, or alternatively a set of six AA batteries, for greater convenience when traveling. Canon's Semi Hard Case EH/7-L can accommodate the EOS 20D with a small zoom lens (EF-S17-85mm f/4-5.6 IS USM included), and the EOS 20D is compatible with Canon's DVK-E2 image data verification kit to check original image data authenticity, whenever verification is essential.What's in the BoxEOS 20D digital camera, Lithium-ion battery pack (BP-511A) with protective cover, battery charger (CG-580), USB cable (IFC-400PCU), video cable (VC-100), EB eyecup, wide neck strap, EOS Digital Solutions Software CD-ROM, Adobe Photoshop Elements 2.0 Software CD-ROM, EOS 20D instruction manual, 1-year USA limited warranty</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B0002XQI2E-A3V782H65DR6V1')" id="toggleBtn-B0002XQI2E-A3V782H65DR6V1">Show more</button>

      <div class="question">I'm plainning to purchase this as a gift next week. Is the camera is still 100% working order and the body in great condition?</div>
      <div class="answer">Gregory, I don't know if you are purchasing the Canon 20D camera body from the same person that I did. If so then this is what I think. After much research on the camera, I found it was the top of the line, of all cameras, when it first came out. The original price was up around $1800 and had more \"bells and Whistles\" on it than you could imagine. It was stated that it was in very good condition. When I got it in the mail, I found everything was sealed in its original wrappings and the manual's pages were not even bent. I really believe that it had never been out of the original box. It was in mint condition. I am using it strictly for astrophotography on my 3 large telescopes. It is performing flawlessly. I still had a couple of lenses from my old 35mm film camera, so I bought an adapter for the 20D so I could use the lenses. The photos are great. The 20D was made back in 2004, I believe, but it is far from being obsolete. It has a great range of speed and apertures and the ISO is very good. It even has an electronic noise reducer that gets rid of graininess when you go above 800 ISO. That works very well. Go for it. Ron</div>

      <div class="reviewText">I purchased this HT to use on farm.  I am able to communicate to base and mobile stations on all parts of the farm with excellent clarity even on the low power setting.  Farm is rolling hills and woodlands. This unit is larger than the FRS/GMRS radios previously used, but has better range.  I have not used HT to HT at this point since I only purchased one HT to use to communicate back to base or mobile.  I loaded it with Chicago Electric NiMH batteries and the charge seems to last all day or even two. <mark>Charging with a 500mA 12VDC wall charger I had saved from some other electronic that had worn out.</mark> Very pleased with quality and price of this item.ADDED LATER: I like this radio so well that I purchased a second 75-785 handheld so we can have two in the field at once. It is a bare bones unit with a lot of heart. So far, very durable. Does not work from inside the steel shipping container we use for storage, but I expected the steel container to block signals, no wireless device so far has worked from inside container. You do have to be careful not to change channel while pushing to talk, poor placement of channel selector. Channel lock would have been nice. Bottom Line, For $31.99 delivered, it is well worth the money.:) :) :) :) :)</div>
      <div class="question">Is there a wall charger for this please help me thank youb</div>

My only concern is that the fabric covering the foam feels very thin, and I worry about how well it will hold up over time.Cons:  The cord is not detachable, and is very long, which is great if you need a long cord for studio use, but cumbersome for personal use.  <mark>This is easy enough to solve by cutting the cord short and attaching a new end, but a detachable cord would be nicer.</mark></div>

      <div class="reviewTime">04 15, 2011</div>
      <div class="reviewText">A few years ago we went to Ireland (shooting with a Canon G9) and I was constantly frustrated by my inability to capture the *hugeness* of many indoor churches or outdoor castles to convey how immense a lot of what we were seeing was.Time and time again, at 24mm, it just wasn't wide enough for me to back into the corner of a building and capture the full scope of what we were seeing. I decided then and there that when I got a DSLR I was going to fix that issue.Fast forward a few years and I got a Canon 60D for Christmas. In preparation for a trip to Greece (picture added to sample images) I hummed and hawed about getting the 10-22 because I was worried, even on a crop-sensor, that it would be TOO wide.I was debating spending the $700 on this 10-22 lens or spending $1500 on theCanon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L II USM Ultra Wide Angle Zoom Lenslens. A friend had picked up the 16-35 and said it was excellent; a perfect walk-around lens and that he never had an issue with it "not being wide enough".Anyway, due to cost I decided to get the 10-22 and have to say that was the BEST decision I made for the Greece trip. <mark>There are an innumerable number of shots (1300 in total) that I took on that trip, capturing hillside towns, the Parthenon or ancient ruins that would have been impossible with anything narrower.At 10mm on a crop-sensor like the 60D, that gives me an effective 16mm focal point and time and time again I was *so happy* the lens would go that wide when shooting inside a church or ruined building.The slight bending of perspective at really wide angles was a *good* thing I though; I don't mind it, I think it's artistic and helps give a "woooAAAA that is big" impression to friends and family viewing our pictures and trying to understand just how huge these ruins were.Since getting back I actually ended up buying the Canon 16-35 f/2.8L II USM after all and have to say that it is "wide enough" for most every day use, but for Greece, I would take the 10-22 again over the 16-35 any day because those extra 6mm make a big difference.If you are like me and trying to shoot huge things and capture them all in-frame, get the 10-22 and know you have an awesome lens.</mark> If you are looking for the perfect walk-around lens, grab the 16-35 or just use the kit 18-135... that is actually a fantastic walk-around lens and won't send you to the poor house.Hope the comparison of the two most popular lenses helped, because I was humming and hawing so long about that choice that I was happy when I finally made it!</div>
      <div class="question">how well would this do to shot a large group of people. i am shooting a wedding and they would like a picture of all the guests.</div>
      <div class="answer">Shooting groups of people with an ultrawide works well, but people on the extreme edges of the frame will appear stretched out. It's also not the fastest lens, especially at the longer focal length, so you will most likely need a flash if you're planning on shooting indoors. It's a fun lens, but you may be better off using a faster wide/normal lens, such as the 17-55mm 2.8, or the sigma 18-35mm 1.8.</div>

When looki<span id="dots-B0000XMUWS-A3KMT1CUNNTSIK">...</span><span id="more-B0000XMUWS-A3KMT1CUNNTSIK" style="display:none">ng at the Moon through a telescope, bright reflected sunlight can produce significant glare. The Moon's disk, even at partial phases, is in fact so intensely bright with reflected sunlight that observing surface details can be challenging due to the overwhelming glare. This glare can be so bright that it washes out most of the interesting lunar features such as craters, rilles, mountains, and valleys. The considerable brightness also reduces contrast on our nearest neighbor in the solar system. To improve contrast and tone down glare easily, we recommend using a neutral-density 1.25 inch Orion 13 percent Transmission Moon Filter. This inexpensive accessory threads directly into a 1.25 inch eyepiece barrel and blocks 87 percent of the light gathered by the telescope, making for more comfortable lunar views exhibiting higher contrast. Once installed on a 1.25 inch telescope eyepiece, the Orion 13 percent Transmission Moon Filter will bring out considerably more lunar surface details thanks to the boosted contrast. Not only will more surface features and details pop out, but you can study them in greater comfort, thanks to Moon Filter reducing overall brightness without altering color. This neutral-density telescope eyepiece filter reduces irradiation, which is the distortion at the boundary between light and dark areas, such as along the lunar terminator. Using a Moon filter also helps conserve dark-adapted vision while viewing the lunar surface, especially when using big telescopes with 6 inches of aperture and larger. The Moon is one of the most interesting objects in the night sky to observe through a telescope. Its rugged surface is a feast for the eyes of amateur astronomers, with fascinating craters, mountainous highlands, and large, dark lunar seas formed by ancient volcanic activity.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B0000XMUWS-A3KMT1CUNNTSIK')" id="toggleBtn-B0000XMUWS-A3KMT1CUNNTSIK">Show more</button>

        <span class="summary">Great headphones for a great price</span>
      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">02 20, 2010</div>
      <div class="reviewText">I came to these headphones after coming from $180 Shure E210 earbuds that broke and these headphones are certainly on par, if not better, than them.  I loved my Shure earbuds and I love these a heck of a lot more.  The sound quality is superb and while there have been complaints about the bass for some, it's definitely not a deal breaker.  Personally, I appreciate the little extra bass these give.  It's not overwhelming, but it is noticeable that these headphones have more bass than others.  There are two major things that people may be concerned with with this product:1) The adjusters at the top of the band catch a few hairs on your head and may pull a few out as they're being removed.  Having short hair is beneficial with these headphones, but if you have long hair, simply hold the adjusters in place as you remove them and remove them gently.  <mark>You'll have no problems otherwise.2) These headphones leak sound just like any other headphone of this type.</mark>  If this bothers you, you may want to look elsewhere.  The sound leakage isn't super loud or annoying, but if you're in a quiet room and listening to rock music at a moderate level, a person a few feet from you will notice you're listening to music.Otherwise, the sound, the comfort, and the price makes these headphones worth it for anyone who is looking for a great pair of headphones.  They easily stand up to headphones within the $150-$200 price range and sound just as good for a fraction of the price.  No, these are not too good to be true.  You won't be disappointed.</div>
      <div class="question">I want to use earphones on a plane, where the noise is very loud and regular headphones are inadequate. Will these be better?</div>
      <div class="answer">These are open back phones. I would not recommend that style of headphone for that use. I would recommend sound isolating earbuds, good closed back super-aural, or noise canceling phones for that type of environment. For the price, you can't beat these- but for that specific environment, they are not the right choice.</div>

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">11 13, 2007</div>
      <div class="reviewText">Seems good so far without any crashes.  It is replacing an older Toshiba PCX2000 that was constantly causing the Internet to go down whenever more than one person in the house was using it at once.  Other reviewers have commented on the FAST upload and download speeds, but it doesn't seem that much quicker.  The Toshiba would be extremely fast for a few minutes and then the it would lose its connection with the Internet.  This one may be slow but at least it stays connected.It is compatible with Cox Communications in Phoenix, AZ, and took only 10-15 minutes talking with a rep to get it connected.  <mark>Having two routers on the same line was causing it not to connect with them initially.Also it works just fine with Mac OS 10.4.10, and the Airport Express down the line, although there shouldn't be much of a worry that it wouldn't work with Mac OSX in the first place.Also it seems everyone is asking $60+ for this modem.</mark>  I just picked mine up at Target on 11-13-07 for 49.99 +tax.  So far so good, hopefully it doesn't go down the drain within the month like other reviewers have stated. ;)</div>
      <div class="question">Mac compatible? Is the BEFCMU10 Linksys Modem compatible with iMac OS 10.3?</div>
      <div class="answer">Cable modems are not dependent on your pc/software/router because they are network bridging devices based on the TCP/IP network stack. If you're planning to use the ethernet port on the cable modem, this will work fine with any computer/router. The only exception is if you're planning to use a USB cable modem - then software and drivers do matter.</div>

Once you figure out that holding the button down takes a bit of time, they pair quickly.  I have a big head and they fit perfect.

You get everything from top-of-the-line progressive-scan component-video outputs to built-in MP3 decoding, JPEG image viewing, and 3:2 pulldown for viewing movies in their native frame rates.Whether your living room is currently home to an HDTV or you're merely thinking of "someday," the CH-DVD 300S stands ready to deliver the full potential of DVDs. Progressive scanning, referred to as 480p for the number of horizontal lines that compose the video image, creates a picture using twice the scan lines of a conventional DVD picture, providing higher resolution and sharper images while eliminating nearly all motion artifacts. Composite- and S-video outputs bring compatibility with nearly any television.With 3:2 pulldown support, the player corrects for a common distortion in DVDs when 24 frames-per-second movies make the leap to 30 fps video; 3:2 pulldown removes the redundant information to display a film-frame-accurate picture.A set of multichannel analog-audio outputs routes decoded Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1-channel surround signals to your audio/video receiver. Dolby Digital and DTS signals can also be channeled through the player's digital-audio outputs (one each of RCA coaxial and optical) for direct connection to a surround-featuredAV receiver. The player has left/right analog audio outputs, too.The CH-DVD 300S is compatible with DVD-R/-RW and DVD+R/+RW media, handling just about any recordable disc you give it. It can even play both PAL- and NTSC-formatted discs, handy when viewing non-region-specific European discs. Other features include motion zoom, screen saver, last-disc resume, and repeat play.What's in the BoxDVD player, AC power cord, multi-function remote control, remote batteries, and a composite-video/stereo analog-audio interconnect.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B0000A0AJH-A2MY9VXHZYAHUZ')" id="toggleBtn-B0000A0AJH-A2MY9VXHZYAHUZ">Show more</button>

      <div class="reviewText">I am really impressed with this little player. First, they make it easy to change the region code setting, which is important to me because I buy DVDs from England, France, Hong Kong, Japan, Australia, etc. Second, it does a great job of properly converting PAL to NTSC and anamorphic widescreen to letterbox for my standard TV--my previous, 6-times-as-expensive player could not do both conversions simultaneously. <mark>And, this player plays almost anything I put in it:DVDDVD+RDVD-RVCDCDCD-RCD+G (an audio CD with graphics; usually used for Karaoke CDs, but for the first time I was able to watch the pictures as I played my Firesign Theatre "Eat or Be Eaten" CD)MP3 filesMPG filesJPG files (like Picture CDs)The presence of Brightness and Contrast controls in the player makes a lot of sense, and I've never seen this offered by any other player.It's a lot of fun, it's not noisy at all, and if it does die in 6 to 8 months like some other reviewers predict, I'll buy another one because it's so cheap, and I don't know of any other player that does so much.</mark></div>

        <span class="summary">Perfect for the Acer Aspire One D255E Netbook!!</span>
      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">02 18, 2011</div>
      <div class="reviewText"><mark>I purchased this player for my 9 year old daughters Acer Aspire One Netbook D255E for her to play DVDs, games and to load Norton 360 on the netbook.</mark>  Item arrived quickly in a box combined with other items from Amazon, simply wrapped in one layer of bubble wrap and put in the box.  There were no receipts etc for the shipment, and only a small booklet for installation on older Windows OS systems.  The booklet DID mention that the unit is a CD/DVD burner, but required additional software to do so (I checked on my Acer 5532 laptop after plugging it in and running a diagnostic check, it is only a DVD/CD player).  It also came with a USB driver disc which was unnecessary for my installation, and two USB plugs, one for media and one for power.  Simple to figure out though, just plug in both USB plugs and Windows 7 Starter did the rest.  However, like others with Windows 7 Starter, I had to download VLC Media Player to play DVD's.  No problem there, except for the additional junk that came with the Media player download which I immediately deleted. The CD/DVD player works great now, and sounds especially awesome on earbuds.  I have a Windows anytime upgrade from Starter to full home version ready to install, but I may return it now that I have this DVD/CD Rom working and the free desktop download correction fixed.Cons:  I was let down that so many others purchased the same unit and received a free upgrade to a DVD/CD burner.  That is not a real major setback since this is for a 9 yr olds netbook, but it would have been nice to have as a back up to our other burner.  One for all and all for one I say!Pros:  Easy,  I mean EASY setup.  Also found it nice that you do not need to utilize both USB cables, just plug in the media plug to the USB 2 and that is all required.  Great price considering the seller guaranteed it would work with my Acer One Netbook model.  Free shipping!!!!  Case seems to be sturdy enough, (just don't pick it up and turn it side to side while it is playing).  Region settings available, so it plays most everything.  GREAT DVD picture on both my Acer laptop and the Acer Aspire one netbook, very pleased!Overall,  I would recommend this to anyone needing a DVD/CD rom for the Acer Aspire One Netbook,  provided you do not want a unit for burning CD's and DVD's..UPDATE 01 March 2011:  The more I use this player the more I like it.  The picture on my daughters Acer Aspire one Netbook is sharper than the one on my Acer Laptop with widescreen HD. If you are an Acer Netbook lover, this is the external player for you.  Just a reminder, it is not a DVD/CD burner.Final Update 04-14-2011:  I finally upgraded my daughters Acer One Netbook from Windows starter to Windows 7 and the new OS picked up this player with no external help required for drivers etc.  I also upgraded to 2GB memory, (see my other reviews), which took all of about 4 minutes to accomplish!  My daughter is playing video games and watching DVD movies off this little player like there is no tomorrow!!  I am amazed that this player has performed as it has.  Total thumbs up for quality and performance!!!  I upgraded to 5 stars, simply based on the overall performance and lifespan thus far.  For the price you simply CANNOT go wrong!!!</div>

      <div class="reviewText"><mark>I've used this lens for 4-5 years for many High School prom and senior photo shoots as well as sports and while there are slight limitations in aperture, most of the photography I've shot was with good light.</mark>  I left a couple of pictures on the main page to see for reference.  Even though I have several very fast lenses I use most of the time, this one always ends back on my camera at some point.  It's a durable lens, have never had any dust in the lens and is built better than the price.Pros: Great glass and optics that give good Boque and brings out the shot you are looking for.  Good price for such good optics.  Focuses fast and is a worry free lens.  Durable lens that was made with use in mind.Cons: A bit heavy (not compared to my 2.8 lenses).  Zoom ring doesn't have good tension and if you let your camera hang with the lens down, it slides out.Over all it's a great lens at the price for novice to simi-pro photographers.  I doubt I'll ever sell it even with the much higher priced lenses I have as it does give excellent results.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">I was a bit dissapointed because I assumed that this was similar to my old Panavue slide viewer however this is not self lite.  <mark>Actually it is just a magnifier designed to hold a 35 mm slide.</mark>  It will do the job I guess and the good news is there is no bulb to burn out and no batteries to replace --so it's cost effective.  I will need some time to work with it to really see it's usefullness.  Delivery was almost immediate and came with a coupon for services from the company.  That's good!</div>
      <div class="question">Does this only hold a single 35 mm negative shot or can you feed a strip through it?</div>
      <div class="answer">This simple gadget is not designed for negative strips but for one-at-a-time slide viewing. There is little magnification and no light provided. It is not much better than holding a bare slide up to a bright light.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">When my wife's father died he left hundreds of slides that documented the family history. <mark>I bought her a way to transfer a slide image to her pc but it would have taken forever to view them and decide which to keep this way.</mark> The purchase of this viewer was just the ticket. It allowed instant and quick change viewing so the slides could be sorted. The purchase turned a boring chore into a fun experience. The price was right, it worked as specified and I recommend this slide viewer to anyone wishing to sort a great number of slides.</div>
      <div class="question">can i take a photo of what it shows so that i can transfer it to my p c.</div>
      <div class="answer">Yes, not the best but I used my cell phone to do so.</div>

Feast your eyes upon the azure curves of Pyle&#x2019;s Blue Label series and you&#x2019;ll agree. They&#x2019;re great replacements for your vehicle&#x2019;s factory speakers &#x2013; you&#x2019;ll hear the difference immediately. Included in this package is a pair of 6&#x201D; x 8&#x201D; three-way 360 watt speakers &#x2013; carrying the high, mid, and low end for a fuller range sound. The non-fatiguing butyl rubber surround keeps your speakers secure as well as extending the life of the product. A 1&#x201D; high-temperature ASV voice coil provides the richest sound, ensuring low distortion and providing an open sound stage. The blue poly injection cone looks great and allows your music to resonate with full power. The 40 oz. magnet structure, 1&#x201D; neodymium film dome midrange, and &#xBE;&#x201D; piezo tweeter are what power these speakers and allow for a 70 Hz &#x2013; 20 kHz frequency response. Includes grills, wires, and mounting hardware. Trust Pyle to provide quality sound at a competitive price.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B00022OBOM-A10LVI0QQ1M7WR')" id="toggleBtn-B00022OBOM-A10LVI0QQ1M7WR">Show more</button>

      <div class="reviewText">These Pyle speakers are surprisingly good sounding - especially for this price.  Not audiophyle quality, but they put out good sound, acceptable lows, and have clear mid- and high-ranges from low up to "Ouch!" volume.We got these to replace the stock Ford speakers that walked away from the back of a motorhome.  <mark>We didn't want to put out a bucketload of cash for speakers we'll use casually for only a few days a year, and decided to give the Pyle PL683BL a shot because of the reviews.We didn't need the mounting kit that came in the box, but it includes all the wire and screws/nuts and fasteners you need, plus a grill/cover.Combined with the Metra Ford Speaker Harness installation was quick and simple and they are a precise fit into the stock speaker enclosures.</mark>  Using the stock head unit, they sound fine, give great volume (without an amplifier) with no distortion and we're quite pleased.  In the motorhome, the speakers face each other, and standing between them gives great separation and the sensation of being totally immersed in warm sound.They're rated for 360 watts, we're probably pumping 15-20 watts into them and if they sound this good, I wonder how good they'd sound with an amplifier..?PROS:- exact fit in Ford mounts.- surprisingly good performance for a $30 set of speakers.- crisp highs and mids, and tight bass.- sound quality resembles an old set of Bose 901's.  This is the "experience" of the sound, not volume or overall performance, mind you).- minimal distortion at high volume on an underpowered, stock head unit.CONS- in our application, the silver mounts for the mid- and tweeter show through the speaker cover and bugs my sense of aesthetics - but I'm keeping them.I wasn't expecting - or wanting - rattle-the-fillings-in-my-teeth bass or sub-woofer thumping.  These deliver a good, deep and natural-sounding bass range - much better than the stock speakers up front.  It's a very satisfying sound.Recommend these for exceptional performance at a very, very low cost.  Have just ordered a second pair to replace the stock front speakers in the door panels.</div>

But despite its large, clunky appearance, this mouse has it all. Designed for those with limited desktop space, the TrackMan Marble FX remains stationary. You operate it by moving a large marble with your fingers while a sensor inside the mouse interprets the movement.Solid and well built, the TrackMan Marble FX has a large, eye-catching red marble. Its weight and rubberized bottom keep it from sliding on your desk, and the curve of the mouse fits most hands (except lefties). Those with small hands may find it hard to reach the left-click mouse button, making double-clicking tricky.Installation is not as quick as most plug-and-play mouse devices, as you must install Logitech MouseWare software to fully take advantage of the TrackMan Marble FX's features. However, the manual walks you through installation, making set up easy and quick.Perhaps the nicest feature of this trackball is the four programmable buttons. During setup, you can program which buttons you want to perform certain functions. Most will want to set the far left and right buttons as on a typical PC mouse. However, the two middle buttons can be set for functions such as universal scroll, auto scroll, zoom, drag lock, or HyperJump and CyberJump--pop-up windows with shortcut functions in Windows 95 and Internet environments.If you're in the market for a trackball and have the time to learn to use a new type of mouse, then you'll want to consider the TrackMan Marble FX. Its durability and low maintenance make it superior and easy to use.Pros:Sturdy and well constructedProgrammable buttonsDirt resistantCons:Difficult for those with small handsNot designed for leftiesRequires software installation</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B00000JBUI-A224QFTS1NPBMH')" id="toggleBtn-B00000JBUI-A224QFTS1NPBMH">Show more</button>

      <div class="reviewText">I was aprehensive a first but now I'll never go back to a mouse.  Four assignable buttons make this a dream to use, especially when surffing the web.  <mark>And those of you addicted to the scroll wheel will love the ability  to not only scroll up and down but left and right using the ball.</mark>  Using  this product has actually reduced the effects of carple tunnel syndrome for  me.  Because I can put my wrist at an angle (wrist straight but rotated  about 20 degrees clockwise) it feels more natural and reduces twist at the  elbow.  Also, since you don't have to move it, it uses less desk space.  I  don't like using it when playing fast paced shooting games.  The track ball  motion isn't a natural movement when pointing in a hurry.  I would also  like to see a left handed model.</div>
      <div class="question">can you scroll with this mouse?</div>
      <div class="answer">Well, I think so. The small left click button I believe will turn it on and off. I never did use it to scroll while I had mine hooked up. I don't think it is worth the price it is fetching now, but I will say it is the very best mouse I have ever used, for comfort and precision and speed. I am using the Logitech Marble and it is ok but not as good as the FX.</div>

      <div class="reviewTime">10 14, 2012</div>
      <div class="reviewText">First of all, the reviewer who gave this product 1 star because he thought it failed to preserve the stereo signal was dead wrong.  He must have received a different product (a stereo channel separator?) because I purchased two of these units and each female connector puts out the same perfect 2-channel stereo signal that goes into the male plug.  The male and female connectors are all standard mini-stereo, ie: 3.5 mm or 1/8 inch in diameter.  I leave this splitter plugged into my MP3 player at all times to prevent wear and tear on the MP3 player's built-in female mini connector, which would be difficult to replace.One more use for this product: turn it around and this splitter becomes a signal merger.  <mark>I have a Samsung Chromebook which has a single 3.5 mm input jack for audio headsets, combining the microphone input with the earphone output on a single jack.</mark>  All of my headsets had separate 3.5 mm plugs for earphones and microphone.  This splitter (when turned around into a merger) serves to merge the 2 headset lines into the single combined line with a 3.5 mm plug which is required for the Chromebook.</div>
      <div class="question">can i use it as headset and mic since my laptop has only one input</div>

      <div class="reviewText">At [the price offered], this CD player is a steal. It is small and stylish, and has great sound quality. The bass boost has two levels and it sounds unbelievably good. ESPMAX is not a good a G-Protection, but the difference is subtle. Battery life is also good, I get about 20+ hours every time I put in fresh batteries.On the box is says limited CD-R playback capability, so I was  skeptical about buying it because I burn a lot of CDs. <mark>Thankfully I have had no problems with it playing my burned music.The only gripe I have (and it's a tiny one) is that there is no pause button.</mark> To compensate for that Sony made the stop button have a double function. 1) it turns the cd player off. 2) when you turn it on again it will start at the Exact place you stoppped it, so in essence the sotp button is a psuedo pause button.</div>
      <div class="question">Can I plug this into my sound system with RCA cables to play CDs at shows for canned music. Also, can I pause it at times? Thanks</div>

The lenses also provide a unique perspective by expanding the apparent distance between the foreground and the background. This Canon 20mm f/2.8 is no exception, with such additional features as a floating rear focusing system with an Ultra Sonic Motor (USM), a 0.8-foot close focusing distance, and a 94-degree diagonal angle of view. As with all Canon lenses, the 20mm lens carries a one-year warranty.SpecificationsFocal length: 20mmMaximum aperture: f/2.8Lens construction: 11 elements in 9 groupsAngle of view: 94 degreesFocus adjustment: Rear focusing system with USMClose focusing distance: 0.8 feetFilter size: 72mmCorresponding mounts: CanonDimensions: 3.1 inches in diameter and 2.8 inches longWeight: 14.3 ouncesWarranty: 1 yearUltra-wide-angle lens for serious applications. Easy to hold and carry at 14.3 oz. (405g). Floating rear focusing system. Sharp images are obtained at all subject distances.The optical performance, fast f/2.8 speed and ultra-wide-angle coverage make this a great choice for many applications, like interiors, scenics, travel and photojournalism. It uses a "floating" optical system for excellent sharpness even at its minimum focusing distance of under 10 inches (0.25m), and with a ring-type USM and full-time manual focusing capability, offers the speed and handling pros expect.Wide and FastIf you need an ultra-wide angle and a large aperture, one of the following lenses will fit the bill. Ultra-wide-angle lenses can capture scenes beyond your natural field of vision. The EF 15mm f/2.8 Fisheye, the widest of them all, has a 180&infin; angle of view. For more normal-looking wide-angle shots, there are longer wide-angle lenses up to 35mm with the maximum aperture you need.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B00007GQLT-A2AY4YUOX2N1BQ')" id="toggleBtn-B00007GQLT-A2AY4YUOX2N1BQ">Show more</button>

      <div class="reviewText">That is the question with this lens. I was looking for a cheap and light wide angle for my gear bag that wouldn't make me cry if it was broken. I'm a wedding photographer, and so it is a little different for me when I go out shooting. I am not just taking photography gear with me, I am taking my livelihood . Cheap was the name of the game, but I knew I wanted a prime lens due to their quality, wide aperture and lack of bulk. I decided to rent this lens and give it a whirl, spending $40 for the week instead of $500 flat out. I am rather conflicted about this lens, as I will outline below. <mark>If you don't like reading long reviews, please skip to the conclusion!TEST GEAR:Canon EOS 1Ds Mark II 16.7MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)(Full frame camera)Canon EOS 40D 10.1MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)(Cropped Sensor)Canon A2E 35mm Camera Body(35mm Film)PROS- Can produce extremely sharp images from F/4+- Build is decent, more solid than the 50mm 1.8- Focus is fast and relatively quiet compared to zoom lenses- Distortion (barrel primarily) is kept in check, better than most super-widesNEUTRAL- Color and contrast needs adjustment on most imagesCONS- As others have mentioned, images are soft around the edges- Vignetting is VERY noticeable on full frame/film- Seems to underexpose images (as also documented on The Digital Picture)Here's the thing, this isn't an L series lens.</mark> I have been spoiled in having the pleasure of primarily shooting with L glass, and so it is easy to become hyper-critical of the normal EF series. This is why I didn't give the lens 3 stars. Compared to a kit lens for example, this lens is a HUGE improvement. The images are sharper, there is less distortion, and you will see an overall improvement in general image quality. That said, there are some serious pitfalls with this lens. The images are sharp in the center but soft around the edges. This is fine with 80% of portraits (as you normally center the face), but as soon as you use this for landscape/photojournalism you are going to notice. Even more noticeable however, is the vignetting. Now, I edit around 95% of my images before they are saved as final copies so a little vignette removal is not a huge deal for me, but if you are shooting and uploading all of your files and you don't want to have to edit hundreds of files this may not be the lens for you. I put the color and contrast issue in the neutral area because I have experienced these issues even with L glass, so I'm not counting it against the lens.CONCLUSIONOverall I am glad that I only rented this lens. If I had spent the money on it I think I would have been disappointed. On the 1Ds, the cons were HIGHLY noticeable. This was also the case on the Canon A2E film camera which is also (obviously) full frame. The 40D fared a little better, as some of the heavy vignetting and softness is cropped out.If you are a beginner/novice or you are on a cropped sensor, I would highly recommend picking up theCanon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Camera Lensand this lens to cover the two end focal lengths normally found on a kit lens - it will GREATLY improve the quality of your pictures and will teach you to move yourself before twisting the barrel of a lens. If however you are a "prosumer" looking for a great wide angle, or you shoot full frame, I would definitely suggest going for theCanon EF 17-40mm f/4L USM Ultra Wide Angle Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Camerasor even saving up for theCanon EF 24mm f/1.4 L USM II Wide Angle Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras. You're paying two of three times the price of this lens, but the quality is absolutely worth paying for.As far as sub-$800 wide angles go, this is really the only prime in the category. It could be a whole lot worse, and if you're working on a budget this is a decent option. In that respect, I give this lens a 4/5 with a strong recommendation to upgrade if your budget allows!</div>

      <div class="reviewText">I've purchased at least ten of these in the past from Amazon.com and they were all original APC batteries with free shipping to dispose the old battery. <mark>But I had sent the link to my office administrator to order the item and the item that comes up is the cheapest one out of the whole list, which in this case ends up being the ABC battery not the OEM one from APC.</mark> I haven't installed the battery yet so I hope it works ok. The other issue is now I need to either pay for shipping the old battery for disposal or find someplace to take the old battery locally which is not worth the $3 savings. I recommend to buy from Amazon even though it's $3 more, saves in the long run.I gave it 3 stars for now because I need to either pay to ship the old battery for disposal or find some place and drop it off to get it disposed properly which is time consuming. I think if they are not going to send you what is shown in the photos, it should be in a separate listing.</div>

Look at the files, Import the pictures, View the pictures, Copy the disc, Transfer the pictures. There is also a choice to: \"always do this for pictures.\" I have this choice (small box) de-selected. I use this product (Memorex CDs) as my main back-up for everything. It stores well. It's portable ... to the basement w/me in a tornado warning, and the info is easily accessible and retrievable. I also use color coded CD sleeves and 3x5 card with a list of the contents of that particular CD.

        <p>Lens-making is an art--Nikon artisans craft Nikkor optics from the finest materials, taking pride in<span id="dots-B00005LEOM-A1MNI6WD5RS7YM">...</span><span id="more-B00005LEOM-A1MNI6WD5RS7YM" style="display:none"> adding their intellect and technique to bring the world's finest lenses to life. They push the leading edge of lens-making in their effort to provide the "glass" that makes the world's greatest pictures.AF Nikkor lenses work with Nikon SLRs for optimal performance, even the very latest. The Nikon 300mm f4D IF-ED AF-S is a compact super-telephoto lens for travel, sports, wildlife and stock photography. It is a super fast, super quiet lens using Silent Wave motor technology, with ED glass elements for high-resolution and high-contrast images. It features a 4.8-foot closest focusing distance, M/A mode that allows rapid switching between autofocus and manual operation, and a nine-blade rounded diaphragm that achieves a natural blur for out-of-focus elements.ED glass: An essential element of Nikkor telephoto lensesNikon developed ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass to enable the production of lenses that offer superior sharpness and color correction by minimizing chromatic aberration. Put simply, chromatic aberration is a type of image and color dispersion that occurs when light rays of varying wavelengths pass through optical glass. In the past, correcting this problem for telephoto lenses required special optical elements that offer anomalous dispersion characteristics--specifically calcium fluoride crystals. However, fluorite easily cracks and is sensitive to temperature changes that can adversely affect focusing by altering the lens' refractive index. So Nikon designers and engineers put their heads together and came up with ED glass, which offers all the benefits and none of the drawbacks of calcium fluorite-based glass. With this innovation, Nikon developed several types of ED glass suitable for various lenses. They deliver stunning sharpness and contrast even at their largest apertures. In this way, Nikkor's ED-series lenses exemplify Nikon's preeminence in lens innovation and performance.Nikon Super Integrated Coating ensures exceptional performanceTo enhance the performance of its optical lens elements, Nikon employs an exclusive multilayer lens coating that helps reduce ghost and flare to a negligible level. Nikon Super Integrated Coating achieves a number of objectives, including minimized reflection in the wider wavelength range and superior color balance and reproduction. Nikon Super Integrated Coating is especially effective for lenses with a large number of elements, like our Zoom-Nikkors. Also, Nikon's multilayer coating process is tailored to the design of each particular lens. The number of coatings applied to each lens element is carefully calculated to match the lens type and glass used, and also to assure the uniform color balance that characterizes Nikkor lenses. This results in lenses that meet much higher standards than the rest of the industry.Internal FocusingImagine being able to focus a lens without it changing in size. Nikon's IF technology enables just that. All internal optical movement is limited to the interior of the non-extending lens barrel. This allows for a more compact, lightweight construction as well as a closer focusing distance. In addition, a smaller and lighter focusing lens group is employed to ensure faster focusing. The IF system is featured in most Nikkor telephoto and selected Nikkor zoom lenses.Distance informationD-type and G-type Nikkors relay subject-to-camera distance information to AF Nikon camera bodies. This then makes possible advances like 3D Matrix Metering and 3D Multi-Sensor Balanced Fill-Flash. Note: D-type and G-type Nikkors provide distance information to the following cameras: Auto exposure; F6, F5, F100, F90X, F80, F75, F70, F65, F60, F55, F50, Pronea S, Pronea 600i, D2 series, D1 series, D100, and D70s/D70. Flash control; F6, F5, F100, F90X, F80, F75, F70, D2 series, D1 series, D100, and D70s/D70 cameras.Silent Wave MotorNikon's AF-S technology is yet another reason professional photographers like Nikkor telephoto lenses. AF-S Nikkors feature Nikon's SWM which converts "traveling waves" into rotational energy to focus the optics. This enables high-speed autofocusing that's extremely accurate and super quiet.M/A modeAF-S Nikkors feature Nikon's exclusive M/A mode, that allows switching from autofocus to manual operation with virtually no time lag--even during AF servo operation and regardless of AF mode in use.What's in the Box:Lens, 77mm snap-on front lens cap, rear lens cap LF-1, semi-soft case CL-M2.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B00005LEOM-A1MNI6WD5RS7YM')" id="toggleBtn-B00005LEOM-A1MNI6WD5RS7YM">Show more</button>

      <div class="reviewText">Well, unlike most of the other reviewers....I use both the 300 2.8 and the 300 f4. The only reason to use the 300 2.8 is when you need to use it wide open. Otherwise the f4 is at least as sharp if not a bit sharper and definitely better contrast. The 300 f4 can be used hand held if necessary or with a monopod.  That extra heft is a huge handicap for the 2.8 in many cases. <mark>I do a lot of sports car racing photography and the f4 generally is my first choice.....generally it is outdoors and plenty of light so you aren't looking for that last stop and the ability to pan with the cars makes it easier to follow the cars at f4.</mark> If you were doing indoors sports, or other events with dimmer lights the 2.8 is the goto lens. And yes the f4 works great at f4..for car racing that is all it gets used at.</div>
      <div class="question">Is this a good lens for high school sports photography? And why? Thanks!</div>
      <div class="answer">I use my 300MM f4 for bird photography and I usually have it coupled with the 1.4 teleconverter. The great thing about this setup is that I can shoot it hand-held and it's not too heavy to carry around. I have a D600 body and I typically shoot at 800+ ISO with fast shutter speeds (&gt;=1/2000). I get great sharpness without a tripod or VR. This lens is great - super-sharp, quick AF, and light enough to carry around all the time. I recommend it - get the 1.4TC too.</div>

      <div class="question">Has it worked for a Bose Wave CD player?</div>
      <div class="answer">Yes. I have a wave player that hadn't been cleaned for five years (I never really thought about it.) It started skipping, so I then bought the Memorex cleaning disc and what a difference. It works beautifully. I also have the 3 disc add-on, and it cleaned those as well. I am very happy with this product. Hope this helps.</div>

        <p>Those who&#x92;ve considered Apple&#x92;s amazing new PowerBook G4 series of portable computers but <span id="dots-B0000U9H40-ASXAYOBF3G342">...</span><span id="more-B0000U9H40-ASXAYOBF3G342" style="display:none">can&#x92;t quite justify the expense would do well to explore its less expensive, slightly less capable sibling, the iBook G4. Available in three flavors, the iBook G4 doesn&#x92;t sport PowerBook amenities such as DVD burning and massive widescreen displays, yet all three models feature superb connectivity, subcompact dimensions, and impressive battery life. This particular unit, the entry-level iBook G4 12-inch M9164LL/A, is the most affordable mobile computer in the entire Apple roster.Featuring a spry power section consisting of an 800 MHz PowerPC G4 processor and 256 MB RAM (expandable to 640 MB), the system packs enough raw muscle for most typical mobile computing tasks. However, the real surprise comes in its 3-D rendering capabilities. Unlike many comparably equipped notebooks, the iBook G4 12-inch features an ATI Mobility Radeon 9200 video chipset with 32 MB of dedicated DDR SDRAM memory. Thusly, it will efficiently handle demanding applications such as 3-D drawing and even some 3-D gaming.At just 11.2 by 9.1 by 1.3 inches and a scant 4.9 pounds, the iBook G4 12-inch is downright tiny. Yet when you flip the lid you&#x92;ll find such desirable perks as a full-size 77-key keyboard with 12 function keys and four arrow keys, a trackpad with double-tap and drag capabilities, a smallish but crystal clear 12.1-inch display capable of 1024x768 resolution, and a combination CD-RW/DVD-ROM drive through which you can burn audio CDs, archive files and play the latest Hollywood blockbusters. For storing your files, Apple has installed a serviceable 30 GB hard disk -- enough space for general use but too little for serious multimedia archiving.Connectivity options include an integrated 56K modem for dial-up communications, a 10/100BASE-T Ethernet port for LAN and high-speed Internet and email, and two high-speed USB 2.0 ports and one FireWire 400 port for external high-tech toys such as scanners, digital cameras and digital camcorders. Users can also purchase an Apple AirPort Extreme Card for wireless communication and an internal Bluetooth module to interact with future cordless Bluetooth devices such as cell phones and PDAs.Bundled software includes Apple&#x92;s newest operating system, Mac OS X v.10.3 Panther, and a broad range of highly useable multimedia utilities. Under ideal conditions, battery life is estimated at a stunning six hours.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B0000U9H40-ASXAYOBF3G342')" id="toggleBtn-B0000U9H40-ASXAYOBF3G342">Show more</button>

Solid machine and I love it!</div>
      <div class="question">Is this a good laptop to use for collage and not for game downloads.</div>
      <div class="answer">It's a good laptop for college, just know that it is older unless the seller has updated it so if they have not then you will be limited as far as downloads go. I actually have a new Macbook Air and with Macs they are already limited and then you add the age would make it very limited with basic downloads like Adobe, etc. Try looking around locally on Craigslist and you may find one that are updated with the newest OS.

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">03 7, 2010</div>
      <div class="reviewText">I've had many cameras, both film and digital, and this one by far blows the others out of the water! A friend of mine bought a 6490 new a few years ago and raved about it - her photos were so amazing. So last year when I was in the market to buy a camera, I looked it up on Amazon. I was so glad to see that not only did they include the camera specs, tons of user reviews, and even a couple for sale used through the Marketplace, but also over 100 photos taken by other owners that I got to appreciate! That convinced me to find and buy one used on eBay, which I did.  <mark>I was lucky, the camera was in excellent condition and have had no trouble with it.It may be an older model, but the operation of this camera is so simple compared with the new ones out on the market today!</mark> I had use of a 10MP Canon camera for a while thinking I might want to upgrade this one, but it took way too long to figure out the controls which were tiny, and after reading the manual and taking many, many photos over the course of several days using various settings, the photos were often blurry, even with image stabilization built in! I found I didn't need the extra pixels after all, and I think they actually slowed down the camera's operation.I do love how the 6490 feels in my hands, too - not too big, not too small (like the Canon). Most of all I appreciate the fact that I don't feel the need to "upgrade" as long as I keep getting this kind of stellar quality in my photos!! Sure wish it used AA batteries, though - that's the only drawback to this camera that I can see!</div>
      <div class="question">In what condition is the camera?</div>
      <div class="answer">Excellent. Currently my brother is using the camera. It is working without any problem.</div>

      <div class="reviewText"><mark>This binocular is great for watching action sports like auto racing and football.</mark> With most binocs you miss the scene by the time you get them in focus, not with these! They are also excellent for bird watching since the depth of field is quite long. The only drawback is that you can't use them to view anything closer than about 30 yards but that's also the plus as you never have to try and focus anything and the view is crystal clear.</div>
      <div class="question">are they good to use for watching auto racing at the track</div>
      <div class="answer">Yes, they work well for any type of viewing in that they are self-adjusting. No need to fiddle with a focusing dial. For people who wear glasses, they can be a little awkward, since they adjust to the viewer's corrected vision, and the rubber cups on mine that supposed to peel back for use with glasses won't stay back. For people who don't wear glasses they should work great.</div>

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">05 1, 2010</div>
      <div class="reviewText">Most of the smaller digital cameras available today do not have an optical viewfinder. They depend on an LCD screen on the back of the camera to compose the picture. <mark>A common problem is that on a bright sunny day it can be difficult to see anything on the LCD screen, except maybe your own reflection.This old style slide viewer can be modified in a way that allows it to be held up against the LCD screen of a digital camera.</mark> The screen is then shielded from the sun and the operator's eye looks through the small end of the viewer.  This system becomes almost like an optical viewfinder.The modification involves cutting off the opaque ( light colored ) end of the viewer with a hacksaw. This is an easy operation. Then lightly file and sand the cut area.Lastly I cut some fuzzy side Velcro that had a peel-off sticky back so I could attach it to the cut face of the viewer and avoid scratching the LCD screen. Some good kitchen shears will cut these narrow strips of Velcro easily. Sticky side felt strips should work well too.This modified viewer has an open end of 1-3/4 inches square which does not cover the entire LCD. However the viewer magnifies what it sees by 2X. I have found that it makes me more careful about looking at the entire scene when composing the image.This slide viewer does everything that I hoped it would at a low cost.</div>
      <div class="question">I read where someone used a viewer like this as a makeshift optical viewfinder for a digital camera LCD screen, because of sunlight glare; opinions?</div>
      <div class="answer">You can see what is on the LCD screen but it is fuzzy, not clear. Not recommended. I have used mine to put a slide in it that I want to make a digital photo and put it up the the camera on the computer or Iphone and take a photo. Not perfect but workable.</div>

      <div class="answer">I don't know the answer to your question. What I can say is this cable seems to take more time to charge phone/tabs and also I get warnings at time that I have too many apps running to properly charge the phone/tab all at the same time. That's when I'm browsing or gaming for example while plugged in. I believe these issues may be due to the length of this cable though I can't say for sure, this is just my observation.</div>

      <div class="reviewTime">03 11, 2013</div>
      <div class="reviewText">This is the best way to control your sub AMP.  I was sick and tired of all this trash that AMP manufacturers are producing that gives you a spiffy looking (BASS Control knob) when all it does is mess with the gain.  <mark>This LC1 actually lets you have complete control of the signal entering the AMP which means that if you want you can turn the signal completely off if you want at the touch of a button, or work the signal to the point of perfection with the infinitely variable signal control.</mark></div>
      <div class="question">Can I use this on my 2.1 computer speakers to control Bass only &amp; not volume of the speakers? I have a knob for volume control but no knob for Bass.</div>
      <div class="answer">Only if your subwoofer connection from the receiver to the subwoofer is line level type. Easy way to tell is if the connections are RCA (like the ones on this device). If not, I don't recommend you use it for that purpose. Without going into an electronics explanation, simply put, this device may overheat if placed in a connection where the receiver output is of low impedance (resistance). These types of connections are identical to regular speaker connections. So, in short, if the connection to your sub is the same type as the connection as that of your speakers, don't do it.</div>

      <div class="reviewTime">12 16, 2013</div>
      <div class="reviewText">It's really hard to screw up a product like this. But Belkin found a way.When I first saw the pictures of this sort of wrapped in a coil, I though "Hmm, that could potentially cause problems getting it to sit down" Well I was incredibly right. This stuff will NOT sit down on it's own, in fact it will be a bigger tripping risk than the wires you are trying to conceal. <mark>You could try using the double sided tape (which wasn't even in my box), but I doubt it would have the stick to keep this on the ground cleanly, and plus I don't wan't adhesive residue on my hardwood floors.In fact, Belkin coils this stuff so tight to fit it in its packaging that it actually breaks down the form of the Cord Concealer.</mark> So instead of being an arc, its flattened out the wrong way, which means the flaps along the bottom don't meet correctly and the you'll have a %$^&# of a time getting the wires to stay in the Concealer while you try to get it to stay down on the floor.After a while of fighting with it, I threw a rug over the concealer to get it to stay down and not trip me all the damn time. Which really defeats the purpose of the product in the end. Maybe in a few months of being laid flat, the concealer will have straightened out enough to be useful on it's own. But I kinda doubt it.It you can, I'd recommend getting a concealer from an actual physical store where they might not have coiled the product.These things have ONE JOB, and that's to lay flat. And Belkin screwed it up.</div>
      <div class="question">Does the double-sided tape peel off of hardwood floors okay (for removal)?</div>
      <div class="answer">It did peel off concrete and floor tile fairly easy. I would recommend cleaning floor very well let dry and then apply came up with little to know residue.</div>

Configurable as a DHCP server, the EtherFast router acts as the only externally recognized Internet device on your local area network (LAN). The router can also be configured to block internal users' access to the Internet. A typical router relies on a hub or a switch to share its Internet connection, but the Linksys EtherFast router channels this connection through the full-duplex speed of its built-in EtherFast 10/100 four-port switch. This combination of router and switch technology eliminates the need to buy an additional hub or switch and serves your network as a completely dedicated, full-duplex backbone. Now your entire network can enjoy broadband Internet connections supported by its switched backbone. This unit requires an external cable or DSL modem with an Ethernet RJ-45 interface. This product comes with a one-year warranty.Note: All Linksys routers now include a special edition of Norton Internet Security!

      <div class="reviewText">Linksys is known for their great products within the network industry, and this is certainly one of those products. <mark>The Linksys BEFSR41 router is great to get your network going and is a snap to set up.</mark> The colorful instruction sheet makes setup extremely easy. There are NO drivers to worry about and add-ons including hubs and WAPs are also very easy to install with this router. The router also comes with a CD that helps you with troubleshooting and links you to Linksys.com so you can have updated firmware. The only thing the router does not have is an extra ethernet cable, so you may need one to finish the hookup (need two total: one from modem to router; second from router to computer). I recommend the &quot;Fast CAT5e Networking Cable&quot; by Belkin. With a built-in firewall, the BEFSR41 is a must-buy.</div>
      <div class="question">router question: What is this called specifically or what should i be looking for specifically?</div>
      <div class="answer">Hi! A gateway is what you're interested in. Gateway's are a combination of cable modem and router all in one device. The advantage of a gateway is there's less clutter with only the one device. Also, there's one less device to plug into your wall outlet for power too. It's possible that your ISP might be able to supply you with a gateway, instead of a cable modem...Give them a call. Hope this helps! JM</div>

It offers the highest quality outside of digital and is a good choice for everyday shooting. As long as you just want to document your family's life, and send videos to grandma, you aren't really giving anything up.The CCD-TRV608 is Sony's flagship Hi8 camcorder, and it offers an assortment of features that make it great for the average home videographer. Sporting a 3-inch color LCD and 20x optical zoom, there's really no situation that the TRV608 won't shoot well. Especially when you add in the NightShot mode, which switches the camera to an infrared shooting mode, and SteadyShot image stabilization, which helps eliminate those annoying shakes that accompany high zoom levels.In addition to a few fader and picture effects, as well as some titling options, the CCD-TRV608 offers a unique USB streaming mode. Essentially, you connect your camcorder to a PC via USB, and with the addition of some provide software, you can stream live audio and video from the camcorder, capture stills, and playback recorded video scenes.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B0000630MM-A360TTXZP5INSY')" id="toggleBtn-B0000630MM-A360TTXZP5INSY">Show more</button>

      <div class="reviewText">The day I purchased this camera the vendor emailed me, very anxious to get a high rating.  They vowed that if anything was not the way it should be to contact them first and they would do what was needed to get the high rating.  This certainly impressed me.  <mark>As it turned out the camera did not come with a battery charger so I emailed them about that and they emailed back saying they would contact me within 24 hours.</mark>  Several weeks later I have still not heard from them.  Since that time I have converted some old 8mm tapes but the camera does not seem to work with the digital format that it should have worked with.  I don't expect that I will hear anything from the vendor, but who knows.  All talk, no action.</div>
      <div class="question">Hi, does this include: battery charger, usb cable &amp; software?</div>
      <div class="answer">No, and I had to return (in less than 24hs) the item because it did not work with my tapes. Besides, they charged me additional (+/-) 40% for handling.</div>

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">01 19, 2012</div>
      <div class="reviewText">Tamron AF 2x teleconconverter for Canon Mount LensesWhen I first tried to use this, it would not attach to my EF lenses (18-55mm zoom, 75-300mm zoom).  I am using a Canon EOS T1i.The teleconverter would fit very snugly on the camera but I could not get either of my lenses onto it.So I was quite upset.  I am stationed out of the country and had purchased it through Amazon while on a visit.  I was not able to try it until I got back "home".  So I figured I was stuck with it and a week later I actually decided I would try and "make it fit" and started to look into a way to "adjust" it so it would work for me.  While examining it for fit I managed to connect one of my lenses to it and then was also able to connect the other as well.I did not make any "adjustments", I figure that there may have been a small burr or something stopping me from being able to connect the lenses.  <mark>The teleconverter is a tight fit both to the lenses and the camera and will work better for it.</mark>  Perhaps I was just not patient enough in trying to connect it the first time.  I have noticed other reviews commenting on fitment issues with Canon lenses so maybe there is a build problem with the Tamron teleconverter...Under operation, with my camera, my auto focus actually worked at full zoom...I was taking pictures of a house & landscape in somewhat overcast conditions in the middle of the day and I was not using a tripod.  I took pictures at full zoom with and without the teleconverter and I am very happy with the results.I am a novice photographer and this teleconverter certainly seems to be worth the money for my current applications.Working now for me.Only 4 stars for the early angst...fyi: I did not receive anything for writing this review...disappointed that Amazon allows "paid" reviews...</div>
      <div class="question">Does this teleconverter work with both ef and efs lenses and cameras? I have a 7d and a 6d, so an apsc sensor and a full frame sensor.</div>
      <div class="answer">this lens would not fit my camera, even though the description said it would. I had to send it back.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">This case gives the phone some extra bulk but your phone feels indestructible. I really wouldn't worry about dropping my phone on concrete while my Galaxy S3 is in this case, which I can't say about any of the TPU cases that I've owned which don't have raised edges that can amply protect the screen. <mark>If you work outdoors often or are on the clumsy side I would really suggest this case cuz it is screams quality and protection.</mark> It is also the only &#34;heavy duty&#34; case that makes your phone look totally different but sexy.</div>
      <div class="question">How is the screen protector that comes with the case?</div>
      <div class="answer">It works fine, as far as protecting the screen, not interfering with the touch function, and the fit. But I always seem to have air bubbles under it, and can't get rid of them. It's supposed to come with some type of cleaner or something, but I bought mine open box and didn't see anything like that. So that might solve the problem, I don't know. LOVE the case though. You don't see the bubbles when the phone is on, just when the screen is black.</div>

      <div class="reviewTime">05 9, 2009</div>
      <div class="reviewText">I've just finished completely converting my first vinyl album.  With all of downloading sw, connecting, reading, re-reading, saving PDF instructions to my documents, saving in windows media player, etc...whole project took about 1 hour.  I am using Audacity SW.  I anticipate next albums will go much faster.When I first received product, I was concerned because I didn't realize the "i" stood for iTunes.  Being staunch, anti-iPod, i was dreading having to download proprietary software and thought about returning.  <mark>As it turned out, I didn't have to use iTunes SW.The greatest thing about this, is that I saved files as WAV files, and played in Windows Media.</mark>  I used WM to identify the album.  It came up immediately.  Labeling each track was as easy as could be.  I did have to be a little careful, as the tracks did not come over in the order recorded but other than that, it was EXTREMELY easy.</div>
      <div class="question">Does this item work on Windows 7?</div>
      <div class="answer">Yes, I have Windows 7 and the machine works. BUT, before you burn CDs with your digitized music, be sure to go into your Windows 7 audio controls and set things so you get the fidelity you want. I did not, and the fidelity was poor--neither bass nor treble could be heard.</div>

      <div class="reviewText"><mark>I have been enjoying this cassette tape recorder immensely!!!</mark>  I don't have a clue about recording on my telephone (I don't have the data plan on it) nor do I know what to do with an ipod.  I needed this recorder for to record songs during choir rehearsals and it works like a charm!!!  THIS is something I can work with...I'm loving every minute of it!!!  I ordered it on a Monday and received by Wednesday, before I had to leave for rehearsal.  What could be better than that???</div>
      <div class="question">Does this play old cassette tapes?</div>
      <div class="answer">Yes, Susan. This was purchased for my 84 yr old mother to take to her church choir practices. She doesn't read music or hear as well as she used to, but she still loves to sing and is very active in her church choir and also a Senior Music Group my sister in law has at her church. So, Momma takes the cassette player and her 120 minute tapes that we also bought from Amazon as they are getting hard to find so when we find them, we buy several, and she comes home with her sheet music and listens to the playback and learns the songs. Hope this helps you in making a decision about this cassette recorder. We have been very pleased with the purchase</div>

        <p>Lens-making is an art--Nikon artisans craft Nikkor optics from the finest materials, taking pride in<span id="dots-B00005LE6Z-A38PFMGB7UP7T3">...</span><span id="more-B00005LE6Z-A38PFMGB7UP7T3" style="display:none"> adding their intellect and technique to bring the world's finest lenses to life. They push the leading edge of lens-making in their effort to provide the "glass" that makes the world's greatest pictures.AF Nikkor lenses work with Nikon SLRs for optimal performance, even the very latest. The Nikon 24mm f2.8D AF Wide-Angle Nikkor is a compact ultra-wide-angle lens constructed with superb optical design for architecture, wedding, and landscape photography. It features 84-degree (61-degree with Nikon DX format) picture coverage with edge-to-edge sharpness. The Close Range Correction (CRC) system provides high performance at both near and far focusing distances, for distortion-free pictures as close as one foot.Nikon Super Integrated Coating ensures exceptional performanceTo enhance the performance of its optical lens elements, Nikon employs an exclusive multilayer lens coating that helps reduce ghost and flare to a negligible level. Nikon Super Integrated Coating achieves a number of objectives, including minimized reflection in the wider wavelength range and superior color balance and reproduction. Nikon Super Integrated Coating is especially effective for lenses with a large number of elements, like our Zoom-Nikkors. Also, Nikon's multilayer coating process is tailored to the design of each particular lens. The number of coatings applied to each lens element is carefully calculated to match the lens type and glass used, and also to assure the uniform color balance that characterizes Nikkor lenses. This results in lenses that meet much higher standards than the rest of the industry.Close-Range Correction systemThe Close-Range Correction (CRC) system is one of Nikon's most important focusing innovations, for it provides superior picture quality at close focusing distances and increases the focusing range. With CRC, the lens elements are configured in a "floating element" design wherein each lens group moves independently to achieve focusing. This ensures superior lens performance even when shooting at close distances.Distance informationD-type and G-type Nikkors relay subject-to-camera distance information to AF Nikon camera bodies. This then makes possible advances like 3D Matrix Metering and 3D Multi-Sensor Balanced Fill-Flash. Note: D-type and G-type Nikkors provide distance information to the following cameras: Auto exposure; F6, F5, F100, F90X, F80, F75, F70, F65, F60, F55, F50, Pronea S, Pronea 600i, D2 series, D1 series, D100, and D70s/D70. Flash control; F6, F5, F100, F90X, F80, F75, F70, D2 series, D1 series, D100, and D70s/D70 cameras.What's in the Box:Lens, 52mm snap-on front lens cap, rear lens cap LF-1.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B00005LE6Z-A38PFMGB7UP7T3')" id="toggleBtn-B00005LE6Z-A38PFMGB7UP7T3">Show more</button>

      <div class="reviewTime">08 17, 2008</div>
      <div class="reviewText"><mark>When used on a Nikon D300 that applies a 1.5 multiplying factor to the length (this 24mm acts like a 36mm on a DX sensor), this lens is clear, collects lights well, and is extremely sharp.</mark> This is a great walk-around lens for scenery, touring, quick crowd shots, and snapshots. With this lens, if you can get the shot quickly and in focus, you will have something that can be easily edited (expecially cropped) in a photo-editing program. Highly recommended as a basic "on the camera all the time" lens.Updated December 2009. Now used on a Nikon D700 full frame (FX) camera for a year. In this case the lens is a true 24mm unlike on the Nikon D300. Scenery is exquisite, and the lens is incredibly useful for pictures of large groups of people like some recent holiday shots of about 25 people working on cooking on a kitchen center island, or two-dozen kids sitting at a table while the candles get blown out. On an FX camera the lens is sharp, collects light well, is virtually always in focus as you would expect from a 24mm. You can get all the action in the picture without being too far away and if you get too much in, it is simple to crop the pictures. In addition to scenery outside, this lens is awesome for large groups of people where you either want to get many in the picture or you have to be up close because it is a party or historical site or museum. Why haul a 14-24mm zoom when this lightweight but solid lens has 90% of the functionality.Updated February 2010. I do not use this lens on a daily basis. In fact I do not even use it every week. But, in spite of this, it is a lens I would never want to part with (I am pruning some of my current lenses to make room for a  new purchase) even if it is not the lens used daily. When you want to take "place" pictures and get the big picture, this is the one that will get the shot and is light enough so that you still enjoy the location without backache. Landscape shots with it from Grand Teton and Yellowstone Parks capture the "hugeness" you feel in those places with clarity, color trueness, and lack of distortion. And the lens fits in the pocket of pants (without too much of a bulge). Carry this little gem and get the big picture. Works great for cityscapes too.</div>
      <div class="question">can it be used with Nikon D300 body?</div>
      <div class="answer">The D300 has an internal autofocus motor, so it will work with the older lenses such as the 24mm f2.8, but because of the DX sensor it will have the equivalent field of view as a 35mm lens on a 35mm film camera.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">Ordered a Nokia 620 from Amazon on June and it was delivered Saturday June 22. Thanks Amazon for "free" Saturday delivery.Now for my concerns. The phones is available in several colors so I ordered a traditional black phone.(1) Something was shaking inside the phone.(2) The manual came in what appears to be Chinese so I could not figure out how to get the phone cover off to insert and charge the battery.(3) After a search on the Internet, I found a review that showed a very unusual and crazy process to remove the back cover.(4) After opening the back, the item that was shaking inside was a small metal item that had a label name SIM. What is it for? Could it be something that broke off during transit?(5) I could not figure out where to insert the SIM. <mark>Incidentally, this phone uses a Micro SIM.</mark> Not the standard Mini SIM. Be forewarned.Maybe if the manual was printed in English I would be more forgiving. But, given all the unconventional mechanical features, this phone will be returned to Amazon on Monday even before I setup the phone to test the features. I am not a novice. I have owned and have been using "cellphones" for almost 20 years since they  were so big and heavy they had shoulder straps.</div>

      <div class="answer">You'll have to use a micro SIM. if you have access to a SIM cutter (most cell phone access. stores should have one) you can get yours cut or use the new one, only you'll have to call your service provider to transfer your SIM. Advantage with the old SIM is that you can use bot the cut outs with your old phone if you want that convenience or get a micro SIM jacket to use on phones that require the regular SIM. I had mine cut to.</div>

The lens is distinguished by a newly developed micro ultra-sonic monitor (USM) that makes autofocusing quicker and quieter, along with an improved zoom mechanism that includes a silver ring on the front for a luxurious touch. The micro USM makes this version of the lens particularly suitable for applications that require a fast autofocus, such as sporting events or wildlife shoots. Best of all, the USM version shares many of the same features that makes the non-USM lens so popular, such as a compact size, a close focusing range, and accessory compatibility. As with all Canon lenses, this unit carries a one-year warranty.Focal length: 75-300mmMaximum aperture: 1:4.5-5.6Lens construction: 13 elements in 9 groupsDiagonal angle of view: 32 degrees (at 11 feet) to 8 degrees (at 15 feet)Focus adjustment: Front group rotating extension system with USMClosest focusing distance: 4.9 feetZoom system: Rotating typeFilter size: 58mmDimensions: 2.8 inches in diameter, 4.8 inches longWeight: 16.8 ouncesCompact and lightweight 4x telephoto zoom lens ideal for shooting sports, portraits, and wildlife. The newly developed Micro USM makes autofocusing quicker and quieter. The improved zoom mechanism also makes zooming smoother. The front part of the zoom ring now sports a silver ring for a luxury touch.With the addition of a Micro USM for faster and even quieter autofocus, this version of the EF 75-300mm is well-suited for sports and other applications requiring fast AF. The USM version shares the compact size, close focusing range, and accessory compatibility of the non-USM lens. For many advanced amateurs, the 75-300 range is ideal as a versatile entry into telephoto photography.Isolate the Interesting PartThe eye tends to see the whole rather than the individual parts. It also sees what&iacute;s near and not what&iacute;s far. By bringing attention to those things missed by the eye, you can create many interesting pictures. It could be the grimace of an athlete, the grill of a classic car, or a girl against a blurred background. Telephoto lenses can also compress images to give dramatic effects. You are limited only by your imagination.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B00004THCZ-A3BHPD32RSZJQX')" id="toggleBtn-B00004THCZ-A3BHPD32RSZJQX">Show more</button>

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">04 16, 2013</div>
      <div class="reviewText">I was very disappointed in the reviews, and I had decided not to purchase this lens, but then I read the review by John Nolley II.  After reading his review, I purchased it.  I have had it for a few days now, and I am very happy with it.  I have not found any focus problems.  It acts exactly like my Canon 55-250mm Telephoto lens.  Most of my shots (about 99%) are Nature and Landscape.  Every now and then I photograph my grandchildren playing sports.  My first test of the lens was shooting birds in my backyard.  They do not sit still very long, so I was constantly focusing and refocusing, and it was fast enough for me.  I see no difference at all with the operation of this lens and my Canon 55-250mm.  The only thing it does lack is Image Stabilization.  <mark>I found myself turning the Image Stabilized button off for most shots with my 55-250mm, and I always use a tripod anyway, so it is not needed for me.Thank you John, I would not have purchased this lens had it not been for your review.By the way, I was able to sell my used 55-250mm on ebay for $107 minus $9 shipping & insurance costs (sold in a few hours), so I figure this lens cost me about $30.oo Net!I absolutely love this lens.</mark></div>
      <div class="question">Does the lens have Image Stabilizer?</div>
      <div class="answer">No it does not... I am an old time photographer and it works great for me...and if I need more stabilization that I get from me....I use my tripod.</div>

You&#x2019;ll have the flexibility to transmit messages without removing the radio from your belt or carrying case. Good news cyclists - the band actually fits OVER a safety helmet.

      <div class="reviewText">I have two of these, one for my entertainment center and one for my computer. <mark>I love how the case is durable, rugged metal, and I love how there are 8 three-prong outlets that are generously spaced so that it's easy to fit power bricks every other outlet or so.</mark> Thankfully I've never had to test the surge protection so I can't attest to how well that works, but the power strip itself works very well. Oh, and the cord is ridiculously long, which makes it easy to position in places where there isn't an outlet immediately nearby.</div>
      <div class="question">Does a power brick block any of the other outlets?</div>
      <div class="answer">The outlets are spaced far enough apart that bricks should not block adjacent outlets. I've never had any trouble plugging in bricks and other power cords into it.</div>

      <div class="reviewTime">01 25, 2014</div>
      <div class="reviewText">I bought a pair of these used, in excellent condition for $50, not here, just for disclosure, I used them as spare speakers in a workshop and this is what I think after listening to them for a while.Do I know what I'm talking about?  I build speakers as a hobby and my main setup consists of Snell XA90's and McIntosh amplifiers.  <mark>So I know what 'good' sounds like and how to make speakers that sound that way.So, as others have said they look nice, I can't disagree there but they are also fairly big, and for as big as they are you're not really getting much sound out of them.</mark>  So, how do they sound?High range: very harsh when pushed, lacks detail, very bright.  (If you listen to anything with violin/piano in it you may want to just click to another speaker now)Midrange: Rather hollow sounding in the upper midrange and weak in the lower midrange and also lacks detail, but it's still probably the strong point of the speaker.Bass: None.  It's simply not there, specs say 40Hz.  All lies.  I've tried several amps and checked the phase repeatedly thinking I had to have messed it up but no, it just isn't there, they'll do a very weak 60Hz as their lowest usable bass and even then the woofers have no x-max to move air with.  To really put it in perspective, I compared their bass to a pair of old 4&#34; Realistic bookshelf speakers (also sealed cabinet), and those even had far more bass than these.Intangibles/Comments: imaging is terrible, off axis response is laughable, any sound that's supposed to have 'weight' to it just doesn't, they sound very weak but aggressive at the same time due to the harsh treble.Cabinet: thin MDF.  No internal fill/damping.  No real crossover network, just caps on the mid and tweeter (which, for this speaker works to an extent, but it is very cheap and cone breakup from the midrange in the treble is probably part of why they sound so bad in the high range.)  Cheap spring clips.  No mounting options.  No speaker feet. Looks nice with the grills off though.Drivers: cheap.  very cheap.  very, very, laughably cheap.  Cloth surrounds (the cheapest).  Woofer has no x-max whatsoever.  Tiny magnets.  Tiny voice coils.Now, for a non-discerning listener who has a subwoofer to pair these with and just wants &#34;big speakers&#34; these are probably fine.  But if you actually plan on listening to your music/movies, please, buy something else.  The Micca MB42X is cheaper and sounds far better (check noaudiophile for a professional level review of those).  If you still want a 3 way design Genius makes a decent set of computer speakers that are better than these and they're even powered.  If you really want bass, get the Bic Venturi 6.5&#34; speakers.  If you want something that looks fancy the Jamo P404's (amazon has them for $150 at the moment, I bought those, at that price you're basically stealing them, they sound phenomenal and I'll review them after they've broken in a bit more; but if that deal ends then the HiVi D-1080-IV gets my vote, HiVi makes great drivers and very well designed speakers).  I've made finding/modding cheap speakers that aren't terrible a bit of an extra hobby, and these were anything but a diamond in the rough.</div>
      <div class="question">are these speakers any good for everything like watching videos or just music?</div>
      <div class="answer">They are but they are not the kind of speakers. Thst you can blast. You can play music with them, you can use them for listening to video's. But if you're gonna use them for X-Box games, you can't blast them.</div>

        <p>Music lovers rejoice! Those looking for the ultimate in CD playback from an audiophile-grade compone<span id="dots-B0000EZ1KK-AQ55CAW0UJ47H">...</span><span id="more-B0000EZ1KK-AQ55CAW0UJ47H" style="display:none">nt will be impressed with a high-precision, multi-bit D/A converter and 128 x oversampling. Others looking for convenience will thrill at the sight of 6-disc capability, 6 repeat modes, 40 track programming&#x97;and no worries about interruptions to your music, with the ability to change 5 discs while the last one is still playing. All will marvel at the crystal-clear playback, enhanced by our exclusive VLSC (Vector Linear Shaping Circuitry), for a smoother sounding audio signal. Just as crucial to your sonic enjoyment is Direct Digital Path, a heavily shielded, high-quality cable that protects the delicate audio signal from noise emitted by the surrounding circuits. Housed in a sturdy chassis graced with a brushed aluminum front panel, the DX-C390 is ready to provide hours of uninterrupted music&#x97;for the soundtrack to your life.Key Technology Features:192 kHz/24bit AD Converters:Costly, extremely powerful digital-to-analog converters , that not only boast a dynamic range of 120 dB, they process information faster and are virtually resistant to clock jitter, to ensure the best possible performance from DVD-Audio, DVD-Video and audio CD.RI (Remote Interactive):With Onkyo&#x92;s exclusive RI (Remote Interactive) system capability, you can integrate and operate all compatible components through a single remote control. What&#x92;s more, RI capability enables you to simply connect the iPod&#xAE; to your receiver through Onkyo&#x92;s RI Dock for the iPod (DS-A1). Your iPod effectively becomes another Onkyo component from which you can relish a fuller sound that just can&#x92;t be experienced through headphones. RI capability will also give you remote operability of your iPod for hands-off control over your digital music.VLSC (Vector Linear Shaping Circuitry):Conventional D/A conversion methods reduce digital pulse noise at the conversion stage but can&#x92;t remove it completely. Previously only found on our high-end components, VLSC (Vector Linear Shaping Circuitry) employs a unique D/A conversion circuit to overcome this problem. Data is converted between sampling points and these points are joined with analog vectors in real-time to produce a smooth output wave form. The result &#x97; a virtually noiseless, smooth analog signal based on the digital source to bring out even the most subtle of nuances in your music, movie soundtracks and even MP3s.MP3 Playback:This audio format achieves about a 10:1 compression over conventional CD audio. What does this mean? You can store many more songs using the same amount of space. For example, a standard 650MB CD can hold more than 200 songs in MP3 format. Various bitrates allow for higher or lower quality, depending on the desired sound quality of the final recording.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B0000EZ1KK-AQ55CAW0UJ47H')" id="toggleBtn-B0000EZ1KK-AQ55CAW0UJ47H">Show more</button>

      <div class="reviewText"><mark>While I am very happy with the sound quality and look of this &#34;stereo system component&#34; I was a bit miffed when it was delivered and I realized that this piece is essentially a CD changer, not a player.The item listing says: 6 Disc CD Player, which I took to mean that it was a fully functional CD player and all I had to do was plug it in and start enjoying my music.After reading the manual and going back online and seeing some additional reviews, I realized that it was only one component.I had to order an additional piece of equipment, as well as new speakers, in order for me to play my CDs.So, it did cost me much more than I had initially anticipated.That being said, I am very happy with the quality and functioning of this piece and am very happy with its capability to hold/play 6 CDs, as well as a remote control (which came with batteries -- a definite plus) and listening options such as shuffle, repeat, etc.I probably could have hooked up my old speakers to this system, but was afraid it would negatively impact the sound quality.</mark></div>
      <div class="question">what about the speakers for this system?</div>
      <div class="answer">You have to connect this to a receiver or amplifier. The speakers are connected to the receiver. You choose the receiver and speakers.</div>

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">06 3, 2010</div>
      <div class="reviewText">I recently replaced my cable provider with AT&T;'s UVERSE, a combination of internet, cable TV, and telephone.  My PCs and other devices were hooked together with a Linksys network, but the installer told me that the Linksys devices wouldn't work properly with his equipment, and everything had to hook directly into the AT&T; box.  After pulling lots of cable, he hooked up 4 devices, and that was it.  Everything else had to be wireless, or I was told to get a Netgear switch.  After some internet research I found I could probably get the Linksys to work, but the Netgear was reasonably priced and should be worry-free.Sure enough, the install took all of 5 minutes, including swapping cables from the AT&T; box to the Netgear box.  <mark>Everything worked perfectly, no problems encountered or adjustments needed.If you have UVERSE, and need more ports for your devices, this is just what you're looking for.</mark>  If only all networking problems were this easily solved!</div>
      <div class="question">My wireless router wired ports are all used up. Will this switch allow me to expand the number of ports while keeping my wireless router going?</div>
      <div class="answer">Absolutely. That's what it is designed for. Happy new year.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">I've had this case for about 2 weeks now and I noticed that the screen on my phone was acting funny when I used the S Pen.  Come to find out the problem area on my screen is where the magnet of the case holds it closed.  Upon further reading of the user manual for the Note 2, you should not expose the phone to magnetic fields for long periods of time.  Luckily after removing my phone from this case, the screen has returned to normal.  <mark>This is a really nice case and I liked it, but since the closure is magnetic, and after seeing the effects of it on my phone's screen, I do not recommend anyone using this case for their Note 2.</mark>  If there was a version with maybe a velcro closure, I would for sure purchase it.</div>
      <div class="question">Has anyone purchased this case for use with their "Note 2" - of so, how well does it hold your phone in place ?</div>

      <div class="reviewText"><mark>I have been using this unit for over a month now, and after having tried other, similar products, I can say that this is the best bang for your buck.While the audio quality is, as with every FM transmitter, not CD quality, it is definitely good.</mark> The signal is strong and can over-power most local radio stations. It charges the iPod fast, fits in my Ford Ranger perfect without using the extension, and is convenient to use.The only other product anywhere close in quality is the Monster iCarPlay, which does not include a cradle, so your accessing your iPod is very distracting while driving.The changing of channels is very easy compared to other products with two easily accessible buttons.It fits all kinds of iPods...even the iPod video. Meaning on long trips your passengers can watch movies, listening to the audio on the stereo, and not have to worry about battery life.The FM transmitter is detachable and can be used with any computer, powered through USB.If you are thinking about using an FM transmitter, this is the one to get.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">I love this screen protector. <mark>First of all, after I purchased the screen protector, I received an email from the company containing some helpful tips as well as a video on how to put the screen protector on.</mark> I know it may not sound that great, but the video REALLY helped. I didn't think there was a certain way to putting on a screen protector, but there is. I look at other peoples' screen protectors and they contain air bubbles and show they are peeling off. With this one, it does the opposite. Again, the video could not have been more helpful. The screen protector comes with a little cloth, 3 sheets of film, and a little card to get the air bubbles out after you put the film on. If you mess up the first time, it's easy to peel off and try again.The screen protector really is invisible. If it gets scratched up real bad, I still have two more to use ;) The good thing is I probably won't use them for a while because this one I have on hasn't scratched up almost at all. Furthermore, GREAT product. I recommend it for anyone who wants an invisible and great screen protector.</div>

      <div class="reviewTime">05 10, 2005</div>
      <div class="reviewText">I live and camp in the western U.S. and have found this antenna to be very effective. It works either while driving down the road or while stationary, and it's not too difficult to attach it to your roof while in motion, unless it freaks out your cat when you open the window, but that's another issue.I've tried it on three phones, two Motorolas and an LG, and in all cases it usually brings the signal up by two bars. In areas with no signal, sometimes it allows weak analog service and sometimes it won't. Having this antenna has meant the difference between analog and digital service, or between no service and analog. Even if you are getting four or five bars, when you use this it seems that your calls will get dropped less often, or never.There are a few limitations:1. Your cell phone must accept an external antenna. Look for a hole near the base of the phone's antenna, which is often covered with a rubber plug.2. Many phones require an adapter to be used with this product. You will have to check with Wilson Electronics to see if this is the case. If it is, they cost about $10. Your cell phone store may also carry them.3. This thing works because it is attached to the roof of a vehicle. You can't carry it up on a hill and hold it in your hand - you have to be in the car.

The CRF940 accepts video inputs from four separate source components in three separate formats (one RF and four each composite-video and S-video) and routes their AV signals through its tri-format AV outputs. One of the CRF940's four sets of AV inputs is built into the front panel, facilitating spontaneous hookups of camcorders, VCRs, video game players, or other devices.This would also be a fine asset for transferring S-VHS video or camcorder content to an older VCR lacking the requisite composite-video (yellow RCA jack) or S-video (black five-pin) inputs. Accompanying sets of stereo analog (left/right) RCA audio inputs handles the source sound.The unit's gold-plated audio and video connectors ensure maximal conductivity and minimal corrosion so you can set it and forget it--the terminals won't need cleaning for two years. A VCR-like output switch lets you select channel three or four for your TV viewing when using the RF output, and a red front-panel LED indicates power status. A supplied AC/DC adapter plugs into the rear-panel DC input jack. NOTE: THE RED LED ONLY LIGHTS TO SHOW VIDEO IS PRESENT. IT IS NOT A POWER INDICATOR FOR THE SWITCH.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B00008X5DD-A3BPW1LXX5ALUV')" id="toggleBtn-B00008X5DD-A3BPW1LXX5ALUV">Show more</button>

      <div class="reviewText">Now just this one warning for you folks. AV inputs and S video inputs on newer TVs are starting to disappearing. These plug in types are getting to be old technology, but of course this unit helps you still able to hook up to the newer and older TVs without the RCA AV and S video hookups. So don't throw out the old video games and DVD and more players with just theses old hook ups. This unit is great. <mark>Even lets you hook up to 4 and through the cable/Antenna line and converts it to channel 3 or 4 viewing if that is the only way to see like on an old TV or newer sets.</mark> And has the Video outputs if you just need to use as a switch on your one AV/S video plug in. Got to love it. Can't go wrong with this one.</div>
      <div class="question">Does it require a certain channel? If so, what channel? (the previous model requires channel 3 or 4). Thanks.</div>
      <div class="answer">Yes, there is a small switch on the back of the box which allows you to switch between it needing channel 3 or 4.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">I purchased this to put on our basement door which we open infrequently. I installed it about 1 month ago and installation was simple. I didn't love the 2 sided adhesive tape that came with it so I purchased my own at a hardware store which is much stronger. So far the battery is still working. The sound level is good. This product does exactly what I hoped it would. <mark>Would give it a 5 if it (i) had a light that signifies if it's armed or not and (ii) if the alarm, once activated when the door's open and the magnets separate, didn't simply turn off when the door is closed and the magnets once again are realigned (a composed and confident intruder can open the door, hear the activated alarm briefly, and then close the door to turn it off).</mark> Otherwise great product at a reasonable price.</div>
      <div class="question">My door and the supporting hinge are not on a level plane - will this item work with a slight space between the magnetic parts (without alarm trigger?</div>
      <div class="answer">It works for me. As long as you don't exceed about half an inch between the two planes of the alarm, you should be good. I used stacked double-side tape to bring the two alarm pieces to closer alignment and have had zero issues (have used these alarms in two houses over the course of the last five years)</div>

        <p>The average home entertainment system once consisted of a TV, stereo, and maybe a cable box. Now a m<span id="dots-B0002EXJ8Y-AM2EK0FNR1625">...</span><span id="more-B0002EXJ8Y-AM2EK0FNR1625" style="display:none">odern system may also include a DVD player, satellite receiver, surround sound amplifier, digital video recorder, and an HD tuner, along with a PC designed to serve as a digital hub for certain audio/video functions. The RF Link AVS-5811 takes A/V technology to the next logical step by wirelessly transmitting audio and video signals from these components to any nearby TV, monitor, or stereo system, letting you enjoy vivid video and hi-fi stereo sound anywhere in the house. The A/V sender effectively lets you send signals to components located upstairs, several rooms away, or elsewhere without running bulky, space-consuming cables in the walls or under the floorboards. With the AVS-5811, viewers can watch simultaneous DVD or satellite programming on upstairs and downstairs TVs, or listen to their favorite tunes on stereos in three different rooms--all without wires. They can also use the sender to watch live video from a camcorder or CCD camera in a remote location, whether for security or entertainment purposes. Users who edit video or capture footage from TV programs on their computers will also find plenty to like about the device, as they can easily send the video from their Macs or PCs directly to a living room TV for viewing.The AVS-5811 comes with a 5.8 GHz wireless transmitter and a receiver with four selectable channels. Unlike more common 2.4 GHz transmitters, the AVS-5811 doesn't share a band with Bluetooth devices, cordless phones, 801.11b wireless LAN networks, and microwave ovens, ensuring a sharp, interference-free video signal. The four channels are also a bonus, as it lets users set up multiple transmitters and receivers in the same area without cross-channel noisiness. In addition, the sender includes a built-in IR remote extender that controls components from a distance, so a user can mute the bedroom TV while relaxing on the living room sofa, for instance. The sender features an NTSC/PAL video system and transmits to distances as great as 400 feet without obstructions. It's also relatively compact at 6.5 by 4.13 by 10.5 inches (W x H x D).What's in the BoxTransmitter, receiver, two A/V RCA cables, two AC power adapters, IR mouse (remote extender), user's manual.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B0002EXJ8Y-AM2EK0FNR1625')" id="toggleBtn-B0002EXJ8Y-AM2EK0FNR1625">Show more</button>

      <div class="reviewText"><mark>While I don't usually put in a review, this works so well for me that I had to put it in.Moving into a new house it seemed that all the cable was in the wrong place for me, and having no basement meant either major work or stringing visible cable to having the TV's where I wanted them.Since I have several VCR's I was able to connect the transmitter side to a VCR on cable in one room, and then connect the receiver side to a TV in another.</mark> There are two walls and probably about twenty feet between them. The picture and sound are as clear as if I had connected it directly through cable. It is interesting how the infrared sender will send commands from a remote in one room to the VCR in another.The only time I had a problem is when I put the receiver end down on the table next to the TV with the TV between the two ends. I moved the receiver end to the other side of the TV and all is fine.I have 5.8gHz phones at home as well as a cell tower within 100 yards of my home. I get no interference in the TV system.</div>
      <div class="question">I want to transmit the TV channel I have on in my living room to a tv in kitchen. I have Dish TV in living room. Will this unit do what I want?</div>
      <div class="answer">This product worked fine for me. I used it to transmit a TV signal (satellite & cable) from a TV in my bedroom to a portable TV that I used in other rooms or outside on the patio. Signal quality was good, but I did notice some degredation when people walked around alot. I hope this helps!</div>

      <div class="reviewText">I really liked this alarm system. It was easy to install and program the door alarms. It took a few days to get used to having an alarm system, and at first I didn't realize the difference between the &#34;alarm set flashes&#34; and the &#34;recently entered the home and needs to be deactivated flashes&#34; so it would go off about a half minute after walked out the door. But after I used it for a bit and waited a minute outside my door the first few times to make sure it wouldn't go off, I feel much more comfortable in my home with it there and I now know the difference in the flashes and don't need to wait. <mark>The door alarms are very loud and would definitely wake me up, the window alarms on the other hand are not very loud and would probably not wake me up at night (which is the reason for the four star rating), but if someone were to try and break in and heard the window alarms I am sure they would help deter someone from continuing to enter my home.Also something important to note about the alarms, the door alarm is loud and will continue to ring until you turn it off.</mark> The window alarms are relatively faint and will turn off once the window is shut.</div>
      <div class="question">Does an alarm sound in the base unit when a breech happens at a door or window?</div>
      <div class="answer">No. Each unit is a seperate alarm. the large unit is not a \"base\" unit. It is a unit of it's own primarly for doors. It has a programmable code and a \"chime\" feature as well. It is VERY, VERY loud. The smaller units are not connect to the large one, nor or they connected to each other. They are loud, but not as loud as the large unit. They only have an \"On/Off\" switch, no code or \"chime\" setting. I bought some of the larger units seperately for my daughters to have on their aparment doors.</div>

I have no such knowledge, and this thing comes with no instructions. <mark>I have no idea what all this "ground wire" stuff is about, as my ancient 1970s record player doesn't appear to have one.</mark> Maybe it does, I have no idea. Instead of just running a standard jack from the headphones output into my computer - which is what I HAVE been doing, and it has worked fairly well - I plugged in THIS mess. Now I have a screaming loud hum that makes it impossible to record. "You don't know what you're doing!" I hear the audiophiles cry. Fabulous. Since this POS doesn't come with any instructions for those of us who didn't waste our teenage years in the AV club, does one of you wanna come over and set it up for me?Maybe this thing is spiffy for those in the know. If, like me, you just wanna plug it into your computer and get acceptable digital copies of old LPs, this thing is a useless piece of junk.</div>

My old color reader was hard on my eyes for long reading sessions, the Nook Touch is great for books, but it does not have internet access or play music and magazines don't really work without a color screen.The Nook tablet has very sharp, clear, and contrasty fonts and is very pleasant to read, even for several hours. There is a night mode, and also a sephia mode for reading in bed without bothering anyone else. Magazines look great on its color screen. I listen to music on Pandora while I read, and when I am tired of reading, I can watch a movie on Netflix or a tv show on TV.com. I installed the Dolphin browser which uses tabs so I can switch quickly among various web pages.Vevo music videos look great, but the Nook's speaker is too weak to enjoy music. However, music sounds great through good ear buds and when I plug the Nook into my computer speakers.The Nook is an e-reader, NOT an I-Pad or high powered tablet. It does not have access to Google Play to obtain apps, so you are limited to the apps in the Nook app store. Those apps have been developed just for the Nook and its seven inch screen. The apps in Google Play are mostly designed for the smaller screens of cell phones, while Nook apps are designed just for the Nook.Bottom line: the Nook Tablet 8gb is a terrific way to read books and magazines while enjoying your favorite music (I loaded a 16gb memory card with thousands of my favorite songs...transferring the songs over to the Nook from my laptop was fast and easy).For folks who want the "full" tablet experience, Amazon.com sells the N2A card which enables you to boot your Nook into a full tablet mode, with access to Google Play, and the 400,000 apps available there. And, the N2A card also permits booting the Nook back into its original Nook settings, as the card does not modify any of the Nook's software or settings.</div>

      <div class="reviewTime">04 11, 2011</div>
      <div class="reviewText">In General:First I want to make a disclaimer. I sell a lot of these on Amazon Marketplace. I also use one on a daily basis. This review was written on my Dana. It is so light and portable that I bring my Dana with me almost everywhere, in my car, on my walks, in the subway, on my bicycle, and even on my skateboard. I have sold several to people whom I met in this or that cafe while I was typing away on my Dana.In the summer of 2010 I decided to write a book. But I found my laptop to be too cumbersome and I was always worried that it would get stolen whenever I had it with me in public. So I set about finding a writing tool which was portable and inexpensive. After trying several devices I found my match in Dana.Dana provides me with excellent basic word processing abilities without the distraction of email, facebook, photoshop, youtube, or the internet in general. I have gotten more actual writing done in the half year since I started using Dana than in the 5 years previous with my laptop.Dana & Windows 7 & 8:Not gonna happen. Doesn't work. Unsupported. Fahget about it. Windows 7 has both compatibility mode and XP mode (these are not the same) and neither of them does beans for any AlphaSmart.The only way to make a Dana useful is to have either a separate PC or a second hard drive booting good ole user-friendly Windows XP. I use my old XP laptop to sync my Dana to the same external drive to which my regular PC backs up. *Voila* Problem solved.Do NOT buy a Dana if you use Windows 7 and are not willing to do this extra step. This will probably apply to Windows 8 as well.Supposedly (according to RenLearn) you CAN sync from Windows 7 if you use the IR pod. But I haven't verified this. (as of 9/1/12)Writing On The Go:Dana provides excellent distraction free basic word processing capabiity in an extremely portable package. Dana saves files as Rich Text. You have the same functions found in programs like MS WordPad. You can indent, bold, italicize, and make bullet lists. The keyboard is one of the best I have ever used. It is like typing on silk. The keys are concave to fit the shape of your finger tips, they depress easily, and have gentle but firm return. You can save as many files as will fit in the 8MB or 16MB of memory. Dana also has an excellent  built in screen-backlight in case you are typing in dim light, as I often do.Dana is way more durable than a laptop and weighs only about 2 pounds and fits easily in most backpacks. I often type with Dana on my lap without any discomfort. It turns on in about one and half seconds and is usually ready to work before I am. Because Dana is so energy efficient I have never had the batteries drop dead on me. And since Dana can recharge through the USB port and I sync my Dana to my PC every day that I write they will probably never go dead on me. According to the manufacturer specs, Dana can run up to 25 hours on a single charge.Cables & Software:People often ask me about cables and getting information to their computer. With Dana this is very easy. The manufacturer provides free downloadable desktop software for Mac & PC which backs up and syncs all the data between Dana and you computer. The software is Palm OS based and includes all the features found on the old Palm Pilots. The calendar is an excellent stand-alone application.Cables are not a problem. Even though there are several ports in the back of Dana, the only one you really need is the USB port. Dana takes a type-B USB cable. This is the same kind that goes to your USB printer. These can be purchased easily and cheaply. These are so common that you may already have an extra one. And odds are that even if you don't have one, your friend or neighbor does. <mark>Maybe if you ask they will give it to you.Dana has a an additional USB printer port for direct printing.</mark> But I haven't tried it as I always print from my PC. Though it will power one of those twisty USB-powered LED lamps. Now I can type in the dark.Batteries and Dana:Beware of used Danas that "include" a rechargeable battery. These batteries may be, and frequently are, eight to ten years old. A Dana with an old battery will frequently crash and lose data, even if it's "backed-up" on the SD card. The solution: replace the battery. You can buy a new rechargeable battery pack for less than $20 from renlearn.comDana will run fine on normal AA batteries. But you must use alkalines. If you try to use store bought rechargeables , Dana will not turn on. You can make it work with store bought rechargeables by rewiring Dana's insides just a little. You snip two wires, wind them together. Then do it again to two different wires. I did that to mine. To do it well takes about 45 minutes and you have to be careful about the circuit boards. There are detailed instructions online. It's a lot easier than it looks at first. The best thing about this hack is that you can use your own batteries and recharge them by plugging Dana into a USB port, though you lose the ability to safely use alkaline batteries. I found this trade-off to be completely acceptable for myself. If you do a search for "Dana battery hack" you'll find the site by V. Fry where I learned to do this.What You Should be Aware of When Buying A Used DanaSome Danas are sold by individuals who are the first owner and used it for their own writing. Most, probably over 95%, were owned first by schools and sold off in large lots. These are often grimy and dirty beyond belief with old stickers and food stuck to them. These require a thorough cleaning. In my experience About 1 in 5 also often have other problems. Sometimes the system board is bad and the thing won't work (very bad.) There are a litany of problems that can occur with used Danas. Sometimes it can be lived with, other times it can be fixed with a reset, and other times it means you need to get a different Dana. Most work fine. Almost all of them have some scratches on the case or screen.The Dana StylusYou can actually get by without one. A ball point pen cap or a pinky fingernail works well enough. But it is nice to have a stylus on hand. There is a little slot in the side of the Dana into which the stylus clicks. The default stylus is black. You can also get a colored stylus in red, yellow, purple, blue, and green.Is Dana Right For You?If you are a writer looking for a tough, portable writing tool then almost certainly the answer is Yes! Dana should be synced every day or so that you write. If you are going to be near your computer most days but don't want to haul your laptop around with you, then Dana is an excellent choice. Dana is Palm OS 4 based. This means that if your batteries die, you lose all of your data. So if you plan to be away from a recharge point for more than a couple of days then you need something with more data stability. An AlphaSmart 3000 is an excellent choice for that because they are more durable than a Dana and won't experience data loss when main power fails. The 3000 however only saves files in plain text and has an 87 page limitation.If you are looking for a device for your child then you should take into consideration the child's level of technical aptitude and motivation to write. Dana requires a level of mindfulness that many young children have not yet developed. Dana needs to be synced to the PC and recharged very regularly. A less challenging alternative would be the AlphaSmart 3000 mentioned above.</div>
      <div class="question">Can I attach my printer via USB cable to the DANA and print directly from the DANA?</div>
      <div class="answer">I just checked the manual which I downloaded onto a CD-ROM and apparently you can print from AlphaWord, the resident word processing program, using the Dana's USB port. And if you have a printer that accepts date via an infrared port, you can do it that way, too. I haven't done it personally, since I've used the SD memory card to transfer the documents to my computer for the variety of fonts and formatting choices offered. Hope this helps.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">I recently decided to upgrade my computer speakers, and the first manufacture's name which came into my mind was Bose.  I have owned several of their products and have always been pleased with them.  My past purchases included a pair of Bose 901s from 1972, which still hang from my living-room ceiling as the main speakers for my high fidelity surround sound system.At the Bose store, my choice was between the Bose Companion 2 Multimedia Speaker System, which came out in 2001, and the Bose Companion 2 Series II Multimedia Speaker System, which appeared in 2004, and which I suspected was most likely a repackaging of its predecessor.  Both systems were available at this store, and the former (I will call Bose I), apparently having been discontinued, was discounted to $70.  I bought both sets of speakers in order to make an A/B comparison.Most speaker companies, and Bose is no exception, do not include their speaker measurements:  they not only don't want to share their "secrets," but also their speakers' problem areas.  As a retired physicist, I am sure I could have gone to my former laboratory and convinced a co-worker to let me come in after-hours to carry out all sorts of measurements on these speakers, such as their frequency response, impulse response, spectral decay, etc.  However, I assumed that the Bose engineers, having already optimized these parameters, left me only the need to try these systems with my own two ears and be happy with one of them.  In my opinion, and in that of many reviewers, this is the only meaningful way to determine the superiority of any audio speakers.  The "yardsticks" in these tests are familiar musical pieces in the genre(s) one likes, preferably music that one has already heard in a live environment.  Of course, you'll never be able to match a live concert or recital, but you can get close to it with the proper acoustic audio system.  Yes, this is a subjective approach, but if what comes out of the speakers replicates the original, whether recorded in a studio or in a concert hall, then the audio system is by definition a good one.  Typically, listening for a few hours lets you ascertain the quality of loudspeakers.Since I mostly listen to orchestral and vocal classical music, jazz, and some popular music, I used some excerpts from Beethoven 5th (piano), Shostakovich 1st (violin), Bucker's 8th Symphony as an examples of a rather complex orchestral work, and few operatic areas and lieder sung by various artists.  I also used a North Indian classical music piece in order to test the bass response of the speakers with the subtle sounds and rhythms provided by the tabla, the drums.  I added a more quantitative check the responses of these speakers in the bass frequency range (&lt; 200 Hz) using sound testing videos found on the Web.Both set of speakers are solidly built, with a sober and elegant appearance, as opposed to the cheaper "space-age-baroque" plastic designs of most other speakers on the market.  They both have a metallic silver finish with a clean and elegant look, as one would expect from the design-conscious Bose engineers.  The Bose advertising department describes, using its own jargon, some of the speakers' "break-through" technical innovations, but what these really mean is something else. I had suspected that the Series II was just a re-packaging of the Bose I, but my tests indicated otherwise.I started my A/B test with the sound generator. Without a sub-woofer, one does not expect a window-rattling bass response with computer speakers, and Bose is no exception.  Of course, with my primitive Web sound generator, I could not measure, in decibels, the speakers' output power as a function of frequency, but as expected, it dropped rather rapidly in the low frequency range.  With each frequency drop, I increased the volumes on each set to keep the power output as constant as possible, and I found that both set of speakers behaved relatively well down to about 70 Hz, and at 50 Hz, both sets resonated  incoherently.  Fortunately, the speakers' efficiency at these low frequencies is so small that it does not affect the music listening, since hardly any sounds are coming through below 70 Hz.With actual music as an input, my disappointment was great!  The overall sounds of both sets of speakers were quite unremarkable, and did not live up to the "Bose reputation."  The bass response of the Series II was slightly better defined than that of the Bose I, but this betterment seemed to have been definitely achieved at the expense of its mid- and high-frequency ranges.  In these frequency ranges, the music was definitely "muddier" compared to that of the Bose I system, which itself did not show a very clear pitch definition.  This was true for the brilliant musical passages as well as for the soft and subtle parts.Perhaps I was expecting too much from those tinny speakers, so I decided next to investigate what was offered by other manufacturers.  I searched the Web for technical evaluations, and eventually selected a pair of Cyber Acoustics CA-896 PC multimedia speakers, at $37.  <mark>So now, it was an A/B/C test, and the CA-896 clearly won.The sound of the CA-896 in the low frequencies was rich and it seemed that the roll-over started at a lower frequency than for either of the Bose systems, and therefore still providing some response at 50 Hz (The test results on the Web claim a 20 Hz cut-off).</mark>  The sounds in the mid- and high-frequency ranges were crisp, and subtle-to-loud parts of the music were clear-detailed and well rendered.Based on my simple tests, I kept the CA-896 speakers and returned both Bose systems for my money back.  I would give 5 stars (out of 5) to either Bose systems for their elegant appearance and construction.  However, I give only 3 stars to their sound reproduction capabilities, which after all, is their primary function, especially given the Bose prices.</div>
      <div class="question">What is the frequency response on these speakers?</div>
      <div class="answer">Technical specifications on Bose products are not published. Testing conditions and means of measurement can vary from one manufacture to another, and specifications may not present the optimal way for understanding a product's audio quality. Thank you.</div>

        <span class="summary">Relatively good cooling pad for the price.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">05 31, 2008</div>
      <div class="reviewText">This Antec notebook cooler is pretty good, but it kind of depends on the computer you have.  I initially bought it for my 4-year-old Dell PC laptop, which would overheat quickly since it works so hard just to function normally.  The Antec worked pretty well for my PC, and I was happy with it.  <mark>However, when I bought a new laptop, this time an Apple MacBook Pro, the cooling pad didn't seem to work as well.</mark>  My Apple still gets pretty hot to the touch, especially when the room temperature is higher.  The cooling fan seems to have little effect unless the room temperature is relatively cool.Additionally, the detachable USB cord doesn't work so well anymore.  It plugs into the USB port just fine, but the end that goes into the cooling pad requires some jiggling and adjustments before the pad turns on.  Sometimes I have to hold it there for a while before the cord finally stays in place.  I've only had this cooling pad for 8 months, so it was kind of disappointing to find that the cord is already getting temperamental.Overall, it's a pretty good cooling pad for the money you pay.  It probably works better, though, with lower end laptops that don't use too much energy or get too hot.  Not so great with the Apple MacBook Pro.</div>
      <div class="question">Does this cooler work for Apple Laptops?</div>
      <div class="answer">Yes it works well the laptop still is warm when running programs</div>

        <p>Feast your eyes on 1,920 x 1,200 pixels in the 23-inch Apple Cinema Display. The Apple Cinema Displa<span id="dots-B0002ILKNQ-AZOXOPGFVXAGM">...</span><span id="more-B0002ILKNQ-AZOXOPGFVXAGM" style="display:none">y line features a gorgeous new anodized aluminum enclosure to complement the Power Mac G5 or PowerBook G4.Eliminate Tunnel VisionThe widescreen design of the Apple Cinema Display line offers a natural format   for arranging documents the way your brain processes them&#x97;longer wide than high.   That's why each display gives you the best view for your work. It just makes   sense to be able to display a Web page and its code next to each other horizontally,   or long video timelines in wide format. Apple engineers find that the nearly   100-pixel per inch resolution is ideal for images, yet allows you to easily   work with sophisticated type treatments or just plain email. This painstaking   attention to detail moves the industry forward and gives you best LCD technology   available.Enjoy One or         Two Artful DisplaysThe Apple Cinema display matches the sculpted aluminum enclosures of the         Power Mac G5 and PowerBook. This strong, anodized aluminum also allows         for an exceptionally narrow bezel, so you can use multiple displays together         seamlessly. The Cinema Display hovers above your desk on a curvaceous         stand, and hardly requires any pressure to adjust the viewing angle from         -5 to 25 degrees, since the enclosure is the lightest Apple display ever,         at each size. And some ineffable quality of pure elemental aluminum just         feels better to the touch.Connect with Pure Digital DVIGive your PowerBook G4 a second display when you're not on the road. Connect         directly to any PowerBook G4 with a DVI port. The DVI connection removes         all barriers to using an Apple display with a PC, if your graphics card         supports DVI with DDC technology for widescreen viewing.Strong anodized aluminum also allows for an       exceptionally narrow bezel, so you can use multiple displays together seamlessly.Adjust your Apple display from -5&deg; to 25&deg;         with little effort.&nbsp;Effortless AdjustmentThe smooth motion hinge on your Apple display requires very little pressure         to tilt the monitor to a different position. This design allows you to         you view the display at whatever angle works for your environment, anywhere         from -5&deg; to 25&deg;.Pure SignalWhen you need to manipulate color in any media, image distortion is simply         not an option. Analog conversion problems caused by a VGA connection become         progressively worse as you move to monitors that have higher resolutions         or longer monitor cables. These issues fade away with an all digital signal.         DVI transmits a distortion-free digital signal from a digital location         in the graphics card to a digital location on the display&#8217;s screen.         This digital connection gives you the full clarity and stability of liquid         crystal technology &#8212; with sharp, clear pixels from edge to edge.Responsive FeedbackPixel response time provides a good measure of a display&#8217;s performance         in media critical applications, such as video, 3D and motion graphics,         or even when you&#8217;re taking a break with a game. An Apple display         provides fast pixel response time across the entire spectrum from black         and white, to every shade of gray.Peripheral Devices on         Your DesktopThis display includes a FireWire 400 hub and a USB 2.0 hub, each with         two ports. So you can connect a printer or scanner, or a digital camera         or camcorder. The FireWire port provides a convenient place to plug in         an iSight camera for video chat, presented beautifully on your Apple display,         or to connect your iPod dock. You can also make best use of all the latest         USB 2.0 devices, whether you're using your display with a Mac or PC.This display includes two-port, self-powered USB         2.0 hub, two FireWire 400 ports and a Kensington security port</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B0002ILKNQ-AZOXOPGFVXAGM')" id="toggleBtn-B0002ILKNQ-AZOXOPGFVXAGM">Show more</button>

      <div class="reviewText">Well i bought this before checking out the recommended cards from GoPro. So it arrived in the mail and i started using it in my GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition Camera and of course i had a default. I returned the GoPro the first time and i believed it was the GoPros fault but now on the second one the GoPro is still not working so i called GoPro and told them and they said i should really just get a new SD card since this is not recommended from them and i have came to the conclusion that it is the cards fault. Now it doesn't mean the cards bad. <mark>Its just not good for the GoPro and i know other people have had problems with this card in the GoPro and some people haven't but if your buying a card just for the GoPro i recommended getting one that GoPro recommends.</mark> Other then that its a good card.Eric</div>
      <div class="question">will this work for the GoPro 4 silver?</div>
      <div class="answer">I understand that it will work in it fine.</div>

You can also call Canon and ask for the info, then check it against this battery. And you can check the battery that came with your camera for the info. (I did all three, and found out this battery is the exact one Canon sells.) I'm sorry I couldn't answer \"yes\" or \"no\", but I would hate to say yes and it turns out to be wrong.

I do not see why you could not unless your recording system has the copyright protection and automatically writes that on the \"master\" cd. One thought though, if you are copying CDs the original cd may have the copyright protection. If that is the case, then you probably would not be able to copy it to begin with. I used these for vinyl album recordings and vinyl albums never had copyright protection. I hope this helps</div>

The DVP642 is not only a high-end progressive-scan DVD player equipped to offer scintillating images on high-definition and HD-ready TVs, it's a tech-savvy player that spins your MP3- and JPEG-encoded recordable CDs (as well as Kodak's and Fuji's variants of the same) and CDs loaded with MPEG-4 and DivX video (3.11, 4.x, and 5.x files), perfect for viewing Internet-sourced content in your home theater. Want more? The player also converts Region 1/All Region PAL-formatted discs (the video standard in Europe) for viewing on standard NTSC televisions (and vice-versa, if only for video CDs).The DVP642's progressive-scan functionality allows compatible TVs to display the even and odd numbered lines of an image in a single pass. This minimizes screen flicker, which is easier on your eyes.Whether your living room is currently home to an HDTV or you're merely thinking of &quot;someday,&quot; the DVP642 stands ready to deliver the full potential of your DVDs. Progressive scanning, referred to as 480p for the number of horizontal lines that compose the video image, creates a picture using twice the scan lines of a conventional DVD picture, giving you higher resolution and sharper images while eliminating nearly all motion artifacts.Playback options include five-disc resume, which lets you pick up where you left off on your five most recently viewed DVDs (not applicable for MP3 or JPEG CDs), disc-lock parental controls, and picture zoom for magnification of select images.The player will play JPEG images one by one automatically, letting you zoom in, rotate, or flip the picture vertically or horizontally. For MP3 playback, the player offers track time display, album and track selection, and repeat (disc/album/track). The DivX media format is MPEG-4 based video compression that lets you save large files like films, movie trailers, and music videos on recordable media.Philips' 4x video upsampling offers smoother images even when viewing interlaced (nonprogressive) signals through the player's component-video, S-video, or standard composite-video outputs. SmartPicture provides optimum picture settings for color, brightness, saturation, contrast, sharpness, etc., to enhance your overall viewing experience at all times.The player will play JPEG images one by one automatically, letting you zoom in, rotate, or flip the picture vertically or horizontally. For MP3 playback, the player offers track time display, album and track selection, and repeat (disc/album/track). The DivX media format is MPEG-4 based video compression that lets you save large files like films, movie trailers, and music videos on recordable media.A set of left/right analog-audio outputs channel audio to Dolby Pro Logic receivers and stereo televisions. Dolby Digital 5.1-channel surround-sound signals can be routed through the player's digital-audio outputs (one each of RCA coaxial and Toslink optical) for direct connection to a full-featuredaudio/video receiver.What's in the BoxDVD-Video player, remote control with batteries, a user's manual, and an analog audio/composite-video interconnect.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B000204SWE-AOKSDIRGLTK4P')" id="toggleBtn-B000204SWE-AOKSDIRGLTK4P">Show more</button>

I then contacted customer support for Verizon who were very helpful but were not able to even identify this phone, let alone activate it for use. I will now be mailing it back and am awaiting the seller to call me back about this issue.Update- After further research, I discovered this phone does not work with CMDA (which is what Verizon uses). Unfortunately, this was not listed on the product description on the amazon site (not the phone's fault). The phone itself seemed very quick, responsive, and intuitive. Would have liked to actually have been able to use it.</div>

      <div class="answer">This S3 mini phone is unlocked and should work with any Wireless company. My sister is using the phone in Venezuela and she did not have any issue.

      <div class="answer">Yes, the models are the same. The only difference -- and I don't know which one the Straight Talk is -- is the international and AT&T versions have noise-canceling microphones in slightly different locations. However, this hasn't been an issue for me even with an international case on an AT&T phone. Everything on the Straight Talk version is the same dimensions as the other two, and cases will be compatible.</div>

        <span class="summary">Nice little radio</span>
      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">01 7, 2010</div>
      <div class="reviewText">I recently purchased this radio as a gift for myself.I am mostly happy with it.It is quite small, about the same size as a pack of cigarettes.It takes two AA batteries so it does have some weight to it.It slips easily into a front or back pocket of your jeans/pants.A small removable rigid belt clip was included but I found it useless as it did not swivel.Overall build quality is nice, does not look or feel cheap.I have found reception pretty good.I will try to explain.I had a Sony SRF-M37W Walkman before this radio.The Sony worked OK , I could never get ANY AM stations , just got static.It could get a few FM ( My fav NPR came in so I was happy) I recently changed work locations and the Sony could not get ANY stations in at my new location (10 miles west of previous location) With my new Sangean I can get numerous AM stations in very clear (more than my car radio parked outside)FM is also coming in very clear (just not the one I was really seeking) I walk all around a large building as I use this radio and it holds the station well.The included earbuds wire functions as the antenna for the radio.They also include a separate antenna wire that goes in the headphone jack when you want to use the external speaker...Though I just keep the earbuds plugged in and use those as the antenna when I want to listen to the external speaker. It's very easy to switch between speaker and headphones.The included earbuds are acceptable in quality.As other reviews have noted the bud portion is quite large so they are not the most comfortable.My advice wait till you try them for yourself to see if you need to replace them. <mark>The external speaker is a nice feature but sound is not the best.It's not very loud and has a fuzzy sound to it...Again very acceptable and a nice feature to have but it's not going to WOW you with it's sound quality.Battery life is good but if you plan on being a heavy user rechargeable batteries might be helpful.It does shut off after 90 minutes to save battery life.There is way to override that feature explained in the owners manual.It also has a button lock to keep you from accidentally changing stations.My only real quibble is that the radio has a rounded bottom so setting it down to stand on its own is impossible!Overall I am quite happy with my purchase.Note regarding my reception area: I use this product in the Western Suffolk County /South Shore area of Long Island about 45 miles East of NYC.</mark></div>
      <div class="question">Does this radio have an external speaker as well? Can you listen without earplugs?</div>
      <div class="answer">Yes, there is a switch on the left side of the radio that you can select to use the built-in speaker. If you don't have earphones connected to the radio, an antenna is provided with the radio that you plug into the earphone jack. When you plug your earphones into the radio, the earphone wire serves as an antenna. If you don't have earphones plugged in, you need to use the antenna provided so you can pick-up radio stations.</div>

The newly reborn Monitor Series is classic Polk: a quality-built, affordable line of high performance loudspeakers for music and home theater. They are highly efficient, so they can be driven easily by unpretentious receivers, and they are voice matched for lifelike surround sound environments. The Monitor Series boasts a stylish look that complements today&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;s flat screen technology, with wood grain finishes and modern Titanium faces, and beefy stabilizer feet on the tower models.

      <div class="reviewText"><mark>I purchased the Polk Audio Monitor 70 speakers 3 months ago.I use them for listening to 2 channel stereo.After listening to them extensively and considering what I paid for them,I should have felt like I was STEALING when I bought them.When paired with the right power source these are just unbeatable for the price.With the NAD C325BEE integrated amplifier these speakers put out an INCREDIBLE BASS response:clean,deep,powerful and tightly controlled,displaying great detail.Yes,DETAIL in the bass response.With this amp and Polk M70 speakers there is NO NEED for a sub-woofer.The mid-range is awesome and the high frequencies are crystal clear with no hint of harshness or stridency.After hooking these up to the new amplifier I was just FLOORED at the quality of the sound that leapt out at me.The human voice is reproduced faithfully with every sibilant and subtle expression captured.It sounds like the singer is in the room with you!</mark> These are beautifully balanced in tone and sound NATURAL.They sound crisp and have great punch if you have the power to push them properly.There are many speakers out there that cost much more that don't sound as good as these Polk's.These Polk speakers have been a  revelation and I am tickled sonically pink.Want the most bang for your buck? BUY THESE!</div>
      <div class="question">Klipsch RF 82 or Polk Audio Monitor 70: Which one sounds better or which do you recommend?</div>
      <div class="answer">Here is my two cents, Klipsch RF82 might has deeper bass performance due to its larger driver (dual 8\") to handle the lower end, but Polk has a more even performance cross whole sound range and it handled the bass very well as well. Polk M-70 has a very similar SPEC and performance as their current running model of TSI500 which cost about $800/pair (which I am using). Polk M-70 ($400/pair) is a much better value (Cost/Performance) compare to Klipsch RF82 which cost about $1200/pair.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">The iPhone 5 is our 7th iPhone family purchase.  <mark>All have had clear screen protectors on the front.</mark>  This product and/or its application liquid (on both sides-per instructions) left bubbles and smears that distorted the amazing Apple display.  Trying to reapply attracted lint from supplied cloth used to remove smears.  The "application liquid" does not allow you to remove the lint.  The whole package just went into the garbage.  The regular, no-liquid, screen protectors are much better.</div>
      <div class="question">Does this product really do much to prevent the screen from shattering upon impact?</div>
      <div class="answer">It does absolutely nothing. My phone fell and shattered again one week after I bought the zag and out it on.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">They shipped this item for free despite the fact that it cost less than $1. I made the purchase on a Saturday and received it the following Thursday. <mark>I needed The RCA-adaptor to simultaneously connect audio from my 4-component video switch to both my TV and an amplifier for a separate sound system, so I can either choose to listen to sound from the external speakers (by turning on the amplifier and turning down the TV volume) or directly from the TV.</mark> I had to get two of these RCA Y-adaptors so I could use one each for the red and white connectors. It has worked very well. The only complaint I have is that the ends were red and white instead of both black. So one just has to pay attention when making the connections.</div>
      <div class="question">Wish to add two additional speakers to My Comcast box,as My sound comes out of the bottom of the Tv,and wish to have sound out front.Will it work?</div>
      <div class="answer">The question is not clear. The \"Y\" cable will not handle the current to the speakers AT HIGH volume levels. At normal listening levels it would probably work. The cable is intended for low level, input signals.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">I was excited to receive my headphones for my Kindle Fire.  When I pluged it in, I did not expect static and off and on sound quality.  <mark>I tried and tried to insert, but a little part of the plug shaft did not push in all the way.After much disapointment, I returned to the store where I purchased the Kindle Fire, thinking that the device was broken.I varified it, because all of the other headphones there also would not fit properly.</mark>  One of them didn't work at all.  They ware priced from about $89. to $150.  I replaced my Kindle with a new one.(Make sure you keep your original box.) I though this would solve my problem.  It didn't.  The original headphone still has some static, but a little better continuing sound than on my previous Kindle.Now I'm at a loss and will continue to find a solution for me by scouting out more headphones.  Preferably a folding pair this time and hope it works.  This is very important to me, as I travel and want to use the Kindle Fire.  I like it a lot and do not need an Apple.  At least not just yet.  I notice that in other reviews, they do not mention the device they are using.  It is hard to know if all headphones will work on all kinds of devices.</div>
      <div class="question">will this work with my Kindle fire?</div>
      <div class="answer">Yes as long as you have a 3.5 mm stereo jack port which as I just checked the kindle fire has</div>

      <div class="reviewText">After purchasing a cheaper reader for eleven dollars including shipping that just didn't work on Windows 7, I got a refund and purchased this instead.  It was twenty dollars with free shipping.  As soon as I plugged it in it worked.  <mark>I read a good dozen floppies without any issues and was able to transfer the files I needed to my hard drive.</mark>  I do recommend this however if you are using windows 7 I'll give you a few pointers.  First off there is no install disc, simply plug into your usb and it will recognize the device.  It will show up under devices and printers so you need to go to start and click on devices and printers and then click on the USB floppy reader right click and open and it should be drive A.  You will more than likely need to do this for each floppy you put in.  It may take up to a minute to read the entire floppy it's not as quick as a standard external drive or usb stick by any means...however it will read your old floppies and if you wish you can even transfer files to it and take it with you.Bottom line, this works great you just need a little patience.</div>
      <div class="question">I have a Brother WP-3500 word processor that uses floppy disks, I want to know if I can use this on my PC to read these disks and copy them to CD?</div>
      <div class="answer">I don't see why not. If your PC recognizes the external drive, you should be ok. The only problem will be format. Your text from the word processor will have to be able to be translated into something your PC can read. If you have a problem, I suggest you give the Geek Squad a call. Tell them you just bought an external 3.5 floppy and you need to know how to download onto your PC. They may have a suggestion.</div>

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">04 11, 2011</div>
      <div class="reviewText">In General:First I want to make a disclaimer. I sell a lot of these on Amazon Marketplace. I also use one on a daily basis. This review was written on my Dana. It is so light and portable that I bring my Dana with me almost everywhere, in my car, on my walks, in the subway, on my bicycle, and even on my skateboard. I have sold several to people whom I met in this or that cafe while I was typing away on my Dana.In the summer of 2010 I decided to write a book. But I found my laptop to be too cumbersome and I was always worried that it would get stolen whenever I had it with me in public. So I set about finding a writing tool which was portable and inexpensive. <mark>After trying several devices I found my match in Dana.Dana provides me with excellent basic word processing abilities without the distraction of email, facebook, photoshop, youtube, or the internet in general.</mark> I have gotten more actual writing done in the half year since I started using Dana than in the 5 years previous with my laptop.Dana & Windows 7 & 8:Not gonna happen. Doesn't work. Unsupported. Fahget about it. Windows 7 has both compatibility mode and XP mode (these are not the same) and neither of them does beans for any AlphaSmart.The only way to make a Dana useful is to have either a separate PC or a second hard drive booting good ole user-friendly Windows XP. I use my old XP laptop to sync my Dana to the same external drive to which my regular PC backs up. *Voila* Problem solved.Do NOT buy a Dana if you use Windows 7 and are not willing to do this extra step. This will probably apply to Windows 8 as well.Supposedly (according to RenLearn) you CAN sync from Windows 7 if you use the IR pod. But I haven't verified this. (as of 9/1/12)Writing On The Go:Dana provides excellent distraction free basic word processing capabiity in an extremely portable package. Dana saves files as Rich Text. You have the same functions found in programs like MS WordPad. You can indent, bold, italicize, and make bullet lists. The keyboard is one of the best I have ever used. It is like typing on silk. The keys are concave to fit the shape of your finger tips, they depress easily, and have gentle but firm return. You can save as many files as will fit in the 8MB or 16MB of memory. Dana also has an excellent  built in screen-backlight in case you are typing in dim light, as I often do.Dana is way more durable than a laptop and weighs only about 2 pounds and fits easily in most backpacks. I often type with Dana on my lap without any discomfort. It turns on in about one and half seconds and is usually ready to work before I am. Because Dana is so energy efficient I have never had the batteries drop dead on me. And since Dana can recharge through the USB port and I sync my Dana to my PC every day that I write they will probably never go dead on me. According to the manufacturer specs, Dana can run up to 25 hours on a single charge.Cables & Software:People often ask me about cables and getting information to their computer. With Dana this is very easy. The manufacturer provides free downloadable desktop software for Mac & PC which backs up and syncs all the data between Dana and you computer. The software is Palm OS based and includes all the features found on the old Palm Pilots. The calendar is an excellent stand-alone application.Cables are not a problem. Even though there are several ports in the back of Dana, the only one you really need is the USB port. Dana takes a type-B USB cable. This is the same kind that goes to your USB printer. These can be purchased easily and cheaply. These are so common that you may already have an extra one. And odds are that even if you don't have one, your friend or neighbor does. Maybe if you ask they will give it to you.Dana has a an additional USB printer port for direct printing. But I haven't tried it as I always print from my PC. Though it will power one of those twisty USB-powered LED lamps. Now I can type in the dark.Batteries and Dana:Beware of used Danas that "include" a rechargeable battery. These batteries may be, and frequently are, eight to ten years old. A Dana with an old battery will frequently crash and lose data, even if it's "backed-up" on the SD card. The solution: replace the battery. You can buy a new rechargeable battery pack for less than $20 from renlearn.comDana will run fine on normal AA batteries. But you must use alkalines. If you try to use store bought rechargeables , Dana will not turn on. You can make it work with store bought rechargeables by rewiring Dana's insides just a little. You snip two wires, wind them together. Then do it again to two different wires. I did that to mine. To do it well takes about 45 minutes and you have to be careful about the circuit boards. There are detailed instructions online. It's a lot easier than it looks at first. The best thing about this hack is that you can use your own batteries and recharge them by plugging Dana into a USB port, though you lose the ability to safely use alkaline batteries. I found this trade-off to be completely acceptable for myself. If you do a search for "Dana battery hack" you'll find the site by V. Fry where I learned to do this.What You Should be Aware of When Buying A Used DanaSome Danas are sold by individuals who are the first owner and used it for their own writing. Most, probably over 95%, were owned first by schools and sold off in large lots. These are often grimy and dirty beyond belief with old stickers and food stuck to them. These require a thorough cleaning. In my experience About 1 in 5 also often have other problems. Sometimes the system board is bad and the thing won't work (very bad.) There are a litany of problems that can occur with used Danas. Sometimes it can be lived with, other times it can be fixed with a reset, and other times it means you need to get a different Dana. Most work fine. Almost all of them have some scratches on the case or screen.The Dana StylusYou can actually get by without one. A ball point pen cap or a pinky fingernail works well enough. But it is nice to have a stylus on hand. There is a little slot in the side of the Dana into which the stylus clicks. The default stylus is black. You can also get a colored stylus in red, yellow, purple, blue, and green.Is Dana Right For You?If you are a writer looking for a tough, portable writing tool then almost certainly the answer is Yes! Dana should be synced every day or so that you write. If you are going to be near your computer most days but don't want to haul your laptop around with you, then Dana is an excellent choice. Dana is Palm OS 4 based. This means that if your batteries die, you lose all of your data. So if you plan to be away from a recharge point for more than a couple of days then you need something with more data stability. An AlphaSmart 3000 is an excellent choice for that because they are more durable than a Dana and won't experience data loss when main power fails. The 3000 however only saves files in plain text and has an 87 page limitation.If you are looking for a device for your child then you should take into consideration the child's level of technical aptitude and motivation to write.

      <div class="reviewText">Overall a good mount. It's a universal mount so it isn't as convenient as one that's tailor made for your phone. <mark>I have the HTC One and it performs adequately.</mark> I prefer a sliding uni-body charger rather than the cable connection this one provides for connecting the phone to the charger simply because it can twist and pull at the jack at an awkward angle. Also the rubber boots that hold the phone are starting to wear after taking the phone on and off because of the spring loaded gripping mechanism.I'd really give this product 3.75 stars if I could, good but not great. Doesn't deserve 3 stars though, it's still a good option for the price.</div>
      <div class="question">Would it fit the HTC One Mini?</div>
      <div class="answer">Yes it will and if you have it with a case(any case) you don't have to removed the phone from the case.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">This tripod is smooth.  I know its not a professional tripod, but it is silent.  I had other tripods that I purchased from Samsonite.  Out of the box, they needed WD-40.  This tripod is lightweight. At times it seems a little too flimsy, but it hold my Sony HDR-FX1 and my Canon XH-A1 prosumer camcoders.I had a special training I needed to record and place on DVD.  Because of the squeaking of the cheaper tripods, I could hear EVERY move I made with that tripod.  <mark>This is what prompted me to purchase this one.Others said that this tripod only works with Sony (as what Sony's website also says), but I found that to be false because it works my Canon very well... from the power to the zoom and record, it has no problems.</mark>  Also, not having to even touch the camcorder cuts down on shifting and movement of the camcorder.  I am going to buy  another because I am pleased with the performance.</div>
      <div class="question">Can you use this tripod for a Canon T3?</div>
      <div class="answer">Yes you can used it with most of the cameras, it fits, but you won't be able to use the electronic commands</div>

        <span class="summary">"High-end Baby Monitors" work as advertised, but "wireless"?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">11 30, 2006</div>
      <div class="reviewText">Some important things to know about this product:How do they get sound from your stereo? NOT through the same output jacks as regular speakers. <mark>Much like a baby monitor, the speakers get sound from a transmitter (which needs to be plugged in, there's one wire already) that connects to your stereo's headphone jack, or (more desirably) to the "Tape Out" jack on the back of your receiver (now we're up to two wires).</mark> I opted for the "Tape Out" option, but my DVD player and satellite box are connected to my stereo via the Coaxial audio cable, which uses a different "bus" (if that's the right word). So if I want sound from a movie or tv, I need to use the headphone jack instead. The plug for the transmitter comes with different adapters to make these connections.When I first plugged in the transmitter, it didn't seem like it was getting power. If I jiggled the wire a little, the blue power indicator would occassionaly flash, making me think "Oh great, there's already a short in the wire." But I soldiered on, anyway, and proceeded to hook up the speakers.Where do the speakers get power (since they're not connected to the stereo)? Either from a humongous adapter or 8(!) C Batteries each. The speakers are already heavy, I can't imagine what they'd weigh with all those batteries. So make sure you have a plug nearby for each speaker (making for a total of 4 wires and 3 adapters for this "wireless" technology!). The adapter will charge the batteries, but ONLY if they're rechargable (duh). I'm probably going to have to take out a small loan to buy 16 rechargable C batteries, but I'll do it anyway just to be able to take them outside. If you use regular batteries, DO NOT leave them in the speakers while they're plugged in.Each speaker also has its own power switch, which also seems to have its own personality. It must be held down for a few seconds when turning the speakers on or off. And it will occasionally take a few seconds to locate the signal from the transmitter which can be confusing. I never found out why the power light on the transmitter didn't work at first, but now everything seems to function OK, so I'm not going to press it.The sound quality is good, but I'm no audiophile, just wanted music in the kitchen without running speaker wires throught the attic or basement. If you leave the speakers on but not the stereo, they will occasionally pick up a little static, again much like a baby monitor.All in all, though, the product worked as I'd hoped, and we can finally hear music in the kitchen (or backyard) without blasting the stereo. Just make sure you've got plenty of outlets around!</div>
      <div class="question">Rear 5.1 speakers? Anyone know how these speakers work as the rear channel in a 5.1 system?</div>
      <div class="answer">You need to have a receiver that offers line level out for each channel in addition to speaker out. Newer receivers have this feature, otherwise you need a step down transformer that converts speaker level to line level.</div>

      <div class="reviewTime">07 5, 2007</div>
      <div class="reviewText"><mark>I bought this microphone for my Apple Laptop because I got tired of using the built in mic, having to stick my face right next to the tiny little hole next to the screen.</mark> I do a lot of spoken recording using the Garageband program and thought the mic would be perfect for this. It worked beautifully right out of the box--at least after I figured out the strangeness of the Garageband program. It is strange, as if you have the Garageband program open, and, in Preferences you select the mic (by the way, the computer had no problem recognizing the mic and loading the drivers) at that point there is no mic working--neither the built in mic or the Logictech. What you have to do is select the mic, then close the program, then open it up again. I don't know if it is a quirk with Apple's operating system or the mic or what. When you unhook the mic while the program is going, Garageband will ask you if you want to use the built-in mic or close the program. Choose close the program because if you don't you will have to go through the whole opening, selecting the mic, closing then opening the program hassle.As far as the quality of the mic I am very happy. It is much better than the built-in mic, and I have actually done some multitrack recording with it. I have finally gone over the Garageband learning curve and now know how the program works (more or less). I wouldn't go so far as to saying the mic is at the level of a recording studio mic, but it ain't bad--especially for $30.00, which is basically peanuts.</div>
      <div class="question">Is this compatible with Apple desktops and laptops?</div>
      <div class="answer">Yes, I have used it with two Macs running Snow Leopard.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">Unless you need all the bells and whistles of higher end motion picture meters. I would highly suggest choosing this product it is very comparable to products costing $100+ more. It feels light but is built to last. <mark>Perfect for ambient exposure and flash exposures, also if you flash is not powerful enough you can set it to see how many time you need to fire it to get the proper exposure, which is great for super closeup macros at high apertures.</mark></div>
      <div class="question">Can this give you a percentage of flash to ambient light?</div>
      <div class="answer">No, it just gives the f stop amount of light upon pressing the shutter button of the light meter</div>

        <span class="summary">Competent and inexpensive: bargain "normal" lens for DX</span>
      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">10 26, 2009</div>
      <div class="reviewText">This is an undistinguished but competent lens, a viable solution for DX users looking for a "normal" lens at a bargain price, and a useful and inexpensive wide angle for FX and film shooters.It can not be said that Nikon spared no expense in the development of this lens.  They spared plenty, settling on a minimalist, simple, proven optical formula, without the close-range correction (CRC) used in some of its more-expensive contemporaries, and with an unambitious f/2.8 maximum aperture.  That last detail, in today's world of small-frame DX DSLRs, becomes the lens' single major drawback.  Today's zoom lenses are good enough to equal the performance of a prime in most regards, making fast apertures the last remnant of fixed-focal-length superiority in the minds of most photographers, and a prime lens as slow as an f/2.8 professional zoom is left with comparatively little to recommend it.  Yet that has ironically led to this lens' one significant advantage: it has remained cheap while prices for other lenses have risen significantly, and for those whose needs it meets, it can be seen as quite a bargain.Its performance is perfectly respectable.  In fact, wide-open at normal shooting distances, it is already quite sharp, something that can not be said for many fast primes, and it manages to provide crisp, modern, contrasty color renditions, no doubt thanks to state of the art - as of its introduction - lens coatings.  It has the nice, rather frictionless focus feel that was common to most early AF primes, with the easy-to-reach, front-mounted focusing ring that was a welcome holdover from manual-focus days.  Many newer lenses, with focus rings hidden from easy reach (behind the zoom ring, for example) are much more difficult to use when manual focus is called for, although most do have the advantage of allowing instant manual over-ride.  <mark>Like any AF-D lens, the user of this lens must flip a switch on the camera body to disengage the focus motor and switch from auto to manual focus.There is one other nice feature of this lens that holds up very well in today's DSLR world, and that it its 28mm focal length.</mark>  While anything in the 28mm-35mm range can be considered a "normal" lens for DX, Nikon's own 35mm DX prime is a bit on the long side for many, and at 28mm this lens represents an excellent alternative.  I've owned and used (and posted a review of) the 35/1.8G, and I love it, but in my opinion this is one of its drawbacks.  I personally prefer the slightly wider field of view of the 28mm perspective, which in my experience is a bit handier for indoor photography in tighter spaces and a bit more natural-feeling as a "normal" lens for DX.  Sigma's 30mm f/1.4 is another alternative, and faster, but I found my copy to be mediocre at wide apertures and would generally hold it to f/2.8 or so anyway, taking away much of its advantage of speed - and it is a much more expensive lens.The 28mm begins to look like a very good choice when its workmanlike performance, its "normal" field of view, and its small size are considered against its very low current price.  For DX users, this lens is not exactly a bargain when purchased new - it is more expensive than the 35mm/1.8G, for example - but used prices are a different story, and for photographers willing to buy used, it can be a bargain.  For a DX shooter on a budget, who is looking for a "normal" lens and who does not already have a professional-level midrange zoom that offers an f/2.8 aperture, the 28mm can be a uniquely affordable and versatile tool for general photography.  Combined with inexpensive standard and telephoto zooms, this lens can complete a modest collection of starter lenses that will leave very few types of photography off limits.  In fact, somebody looking to start out in SLR photography on a budget could do a lot worse than to pick up a decent copy of this lens, a used Nikon D50/D70/D80, and begin making pictures limited in quality only by their own talents.My rating of three stars for this lens should not be considered negative.  I don't think a higher rating is justified, and I don't believe in rating lenses on a sliding scale depending on their price - a four star lens is a four star lens, whether it sells for $150 or ten times that.  It is up to the reader to make their own judgement as to whether the price makes the lens a more or less compelling purchase.  This lens does exactly what it is supposed to do, and it does it well.  The basis for my rating is as follows: the lens performs competently, but not spectacularly, as a 28mm prime.  By itself, that would probably justify four stars, but it's only fair to also take into account its very modest design capabilities.  Its slow speed in particular, compared with other lenses of its type, reduces its appeal; and the lack of a sophisticated, highly corrected optical formula is a factor as well.  This lens, while possibly a bargain and a fine choice for many photographers, is practically the definition of average in terms of performance, and that's how I rate it.Miscellaneous notes:- Vs. Nikon's 35mm f/1.8G: The 35/1.8 is a bit sharper, but the 28/2.8 is sharp as well.  With mostly minor distinctions, these lenses do pretty much the same things on DX, and the 28mm can be picked up on the used market for much less than the 35mm sells for.  The real distinctions between these lenses are the price, the speed, and the focal length.  While most will understandably settle on the 35mm, for many photographers the 28mm could be the better choice.- Vs. Sigma's 30mm f/1.4: My copy of the Sigma was mediocre at wide apertures, removing most of its advantage over the 28mm Nikkor.  It is much heavier, much more expensive to buy either new or used, and has very close to the same field of view.  If speed is paramount, it is the obvious choice - otherwise the Nikon's price and overall performance make it the better buy (with the Nikon 35/1.8G probably better still).- For FX: It's tougher to make an argument for this lens on FX.  FX shooters are less likely to be bargain hunters, and there are better choices almost regardless of one's criteria for selecting a lens.  I can envision a narrow niche for an FX shooter who wants an unobtrusive, lightweight lens and a moderate wide-angle view; and in such a case, this lens' low purchase price makes it a perfectly satisfactory option.  Sigma's 30mm and Nikon's 35/1.8G are DX lenses and are therefore removed from consideration for FX shooters.  The obvious alternatives on FX would be Nikon's 35mm f/2D or 24mm f/2.8D - but in reality, for most FX users the real alternative will be an f/2.8 midrange zoom.- Buying new vs buying used: Good lenses tend to hold their value very well, and they last a long time.  Consequently the market for used lenses is vibrant and relatively efficient.  In the case of this lens, the disparity between the new purchase price and the current used market value is high, and I would advise any prospective purchaser of this lens to find a good used copy from a reputable source, such as many of the used vendors right here on Amazon.  Be sure to price-check against other vendors to ensure you're getting a fair price, of course.  Buying used avoids the large one-time depreciation from buying new and will probably allow the user to re-sell the lens at some time in the future with little or no loss of value.  This is a good strategy for any cost-conscious photographer.</div>
      <div class="question">is this lens has auto focus option? or only manual focus lens</div>
      <div class="answer">Whenever it says \"AF\" it is Auto Focus.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">I bought this tape recorder after I read a good review here. If the review was truethful, I must have gotten one from a bad production batch.  With the volume set at the mid-range, I could hardly reproduce any audible sound. The volume has to be at maximum before I could hear discernible voices without putting my ear right above the speaker. <mark>It also records a lot of anoying background noise.</mark>  I had bought recently an Aiwa micro-cassette tape recorder which turned out to be nearly useless.  I was hoping this one, using a full size cassette and with a large speaker, would not have the problem of smaller one.  But that was not the case.</div>
      <div class="question">Does it have a clear sound and no background noise that comes from the inside of the player., like so many of these do?</div>
      <div class="answer">I did a 2 hour interveiw with this recorder and it was very clear. I also transfered it to my computer and it still sounded perfect. No background noise. I've used others I could not say the same for.</div>

The instructions that come with the keyboard will take you through the necessary steps to install it and make the changes to your settings. It's a piece of cake, really. I bought the keyboard for my wife who is Thai. The only problem she had was that, being a qualified typist on a Thai typewriter, the characters are scattered about in a different order than what she is accustomed to, this being a keyboard that is primarily set for a western style typing format. All in all, though, she's still quite pleased with it and enjoys having the option of typing in Thai when visiting her family's Facebook sites.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">Installation is easy because they give you a piece of paper with directions on it. It is very easy to follow. In addition, they give you a good amount of the spray so you shouldn't worry about running out.The screen is pretty 'thick' and by 'thick', I mean that you can tell that there's a screen on there. <mark>Whether or not that's a good thing or bad thing, I'll leave that up to you.One big con I do not like about this screen protector is that when you touch your nail on it, it leaves a dent in the screen and doesn't go away.</mark> So far, my screen has a lot of nail dents in it so I will have to replace it with a different type of screen protector. If you're alright with these dents in the screen, then by all means, buy this.I've had this screen on for about a month now and there are a lot of nail marks/dents in it which I don't like.Good things about this screen is that it doesn't mess up the color/resolution of the phone. It may seem 'rainbow-y' and 'fuzzy' at first when you apply it, but that's just because the screen's still wet from applying it. It'll go away.The fit is good too, although I think the top holes are a little bit off.</div>
      <div class="question">Does this screen protector cover the phone edge to edge? I have a different kind now and don't like the gap around the edge of the phone.</div>
      <div class="answer">The \"case friendly\" one that I've bought of ArmorSuit does not cover fully from edge to edge, it has about 1 mm of gap around the phone screen. I bought it because I am using a case (Under Armor Guard, UAG brand) but I noticed even with that case I still see 1 mm of space on the edge. As for the original size thats not case friendly, I do not know for sure.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">When i got this tablet, i was amazed at how easy it was to install and program. Customizing the Express keys is easy and intuitive. And the tablet its self is light and easy to move around. It comes with a long USB cable so i can lean back in my chair and lay the tablet in my lap while I work. <mark>Its a little bigger then i was expecting for the total foot print (10.5 by 13 inches) but thats not really a problem for me.</mark> My one critic on this tablet is that there is a lot of wasted space around the drawing surface. I would have liked to see more Express keys and at least on touch strip that is horizontal for scrolling side ways. Over all this is an absolutely wonderful product and worth the money. if your a digital artist or graphic design this is a great half way peace of equipment between the graphire and cintiq.</div>
      <div class="question">Could anyone recommend a printer to print out paintings? Could anyone recommend an affordable printer to print wide format prints?</div>
      <div class="answer">Positives: Have had a PIXMA Pro 9000 for a year and love it's quality (use Canon paper and ink only!). With a simple firmware reload and a \"Type E\" tray it can also print directly on CDs. I find the Pro 9000 to be much more reliable than my previous Epson and HP printers. It's much faster than any comparably priced Epson and it's much less prone to print head clogging. Negatives: The Pro 9000 ink cartridges are expensive and not that large, so empty quickly. Also, since they are \"chipped\" they can't be refilled without overriding the auto level sensing system.</div>

        <span class="summary">Purchasing a Nook Tablet a HUGE Mistake!!!</span>
      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">01 9, 2012</div>
      <div class="reviewText">After months of going back and forth, reading reviews, comparing specs, I finally settled on the Nook for the simple reason that I wanted to support B&N;, particularly after Borders went out of business.  I love bookstores and libraries and hate that they are fast becoming obsolete.Well, B&N;, in its disregard and disrespect for its customers and short-sightedness AND crew of sub-par designers is certainly hastening its demise!  Because they turn a deaf ear to consumers, and have no clue what matters to us, they are cutting their own throats.SOME SPECIFICS:1. Unlike the Kindle, it is virtually impossible to get library books on to the Nook.  I've jumped through hoops, bent over backward so far it feels like my spine will break, and spent HOURS, yes, HOURS going through the BS and I STILL can't read a library book on this @#$@#$ device!  And, no, I don't want to purchase every single book I want to read!  Particularly not at B&N;'s prices.  Amazon's books are far far far far far more reasonably priced.  For that matter, so are Sony's.  And I love and support libraries, though they, too, are sadly becoming a thing of the past.  Its too bad B&N; can't be more supportive of them.  Kindle is...2.  B&N; offers a pathetically small number of real gaming apps~all of them overpriced!!! Most of them boring, stupid and outdated.  Amazon has virtually an unlimited number of apps, nearly all of the cheaper than Nook and virtually every popular game that exists.  Most Android apps can be easily downloaded to the Kindle.  Not so with Nook.3.  Games that you can purchase from external sources like Popcap cannot be downloaded to Nook, but are easily loaded on to the Kindle.Those are just the few things that infuriate me the most (well, other than the fact that B&N; seems to have hired its idiot upper management team from the idiots over at Netflix).Finally, speaking of idiots... I feel like one for choosing to care about a store that doesn't care about me.  I should have figured out sooner that I made a mistake and taken the Nook Tablet right back and purchased Amazon's device.  Don't YOU be an idiot.  The Kindle Fire is the best device.  No question about it.  B&N; has designed this !@#!@# tablet so it won't accept apps other than its own so when it (inevitably) goes out of business, those of us who are STUCK with this soon-to-be obsolete device will end up having to purchase the Kindle anyway.  <mark>Save yourself the headache and just get the Kindle now!</mark></div>
      <div class="question">Nook Tablet or Kindle fire?</div>
      <div class="answer">If your main use is reading (in school), a cheaper alternative would be either the Kindle or Nook E-Ink reader which would only cost $100. I just purchased a Nook Simple Touch ($99 & about 8 ounces) which has a battery life of two months before recharging. It allows sideloading of your own books, has a MicroSD slot, and allows purchase of books as well as software updates using Wi-Fi. Nook Tablet & Kindle Fire have much shorter battery life but are crystal clear color screens, allow video, email, web browsing, games, weigh close to a pound, and cost $200-$249.</div>

The controls are nicely situated, and navigating through the settings using the provided four-way movement pad becomes second nature very quickly. Picture preview comes courtesy of the built-in 1.8-inch LCD screen, which allows for a cursory check of any pictures taken. Unlike earlier Nikon products, it's not possible to use the screen on the D100 as an alternate viewfinder, restricting its use in tight situations, but the results through the "traditional" viewfinder are perfectly adequate.As you would expect from a 6-megapixel camera, the image quality is superb at all levels, from the highest resolution (a mighty 3,008 x 2,000 pixels) down to a less intense 1,504 x 1,000 pixels. At any resolution, the output images are really very good, color saturation is well up to par, and overall the results stand up well. On the downside, perfectionists may well find there's a tiny amount less definition, but there's nothing here to raise anything approaching serious issues.Power is provided from a supplied rechargeable battery pack, which is both light and long lasting--up to a maximum of two hours, depending on flash usage. To recharge from empty takes around two hours, so it would be worth investing in a second pack. The D100 takes Type I and II CompactFlash as well as Microdrive units, which are invaluable for users looking to take any more than a handful of pictures in a single session. Our tests showed a 256 MB CF card could handle around 40 high-resolution uncompressed TIFF images, suddenly making a 1 GB Microdrive look extremely attractive.The built-in flash unit, which pops up above the lens, is powerful and efficient, proving effective in a variety of conditions. Unlike many digital cameras, it only fires a single flash, effectively reducing red-eye without sacrificing performance.It's difficult not to be impressed by the D100. It's a stylish and good-looking camera that proves that beauty isn't just skin deep by providing results well above expectation. The inclusion of the fast-charge battery pack means downtime is kept to a minimum, and the software packages provided by Nikon (including NikonView 5) make it easy to manipulate your images and save them out to hard drive, CD, or DVD. This is not a cheap buy, especially when you consider the base price excludes any form of lens, but for those with deep pockets the D100 is a force to be reckoned with.--Elly RussellPros:Superb image quality--up to 3,008 x 2,000 pixelsNicely weighted, full-featured bodyCompatible with MicrodrivesCons:Noticed a bit less definition to images</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B00006JK37-A18DON5KI1ERFX')" id="toggleBtn-B00006JK37-A18DON5KI1ERFX">Show more</button>

        <span class="summary">Oh Baby... Where have you been?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">08 23, 2004</div>
      <div class="reviewText">I've always been an avid Nikon user. And from now on I'm even more than ever!I haven&#8217;t been able to put it down since buying it in July, 2004.The picture quality & clarity is amazing, as if you&#8217;re actually  there in the photo!I&#8217;ve flown front seat in a helicopter this summer and took some great arial photos! "National Geographic Magazine" here I come!!!This baby has a lot of great functions!The quick speed of the playback monitor & deletion of unwanted photos are must-have functions! It's nice to have only good photos, rather than over-exposed trash. I&#8217;ve been able to take so many photos with this thing, I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;ll be doing with my F90X and the rest of my other film cameras. There&#8217;s no end to the imagination with the D100. With my F90X, the colors and effects are lost during the development of the film and the printing of the photo. Having the D100, I&#8217;ll have less worry over my photo&#8217;s results.During my partner's 25-day business trip, he only shot about 362 photos out of 598 & only recharged the battery once. Spares come in handy, that's for sure! I have a 20-35mm. f/2.8D Zoom lens. <mark>I used that baby left and right with the F90X and it seems to be the perfect lens for the D100 (FYI&#8230;this lens is discontinued and has been replaced by a 17-35 f/2.8D).Our D100 is loaded with a 1Gb memory card that gives me 598 frames configured as jpeg normal, large (3,008 X 2,000) Pixels.Battery life is excellent.</mark> We don&#8217;t have to change the battery all that much, and when we do, it recharges quite promptly. If you don&#8217;t play with the monitor frequently you should be able to take about 1600 shots on 1 battery.Obviously, frequent use of the Monitor takes up a lot of battery juice. I try not to use the monitor much because of just that. Owning this Baby is fantastic, because it&#8217;s saving us a bundle of money on film & reprints.If our friends ask for a copy of a photo/s, we just email them out and it&#8217;s done! No more waiting on Friday afternoons at the photo lab!Some Good Technical Points about the D100:- Dynamic-Area AF (Auto Focus): Useful when you have an erratically moving subject. The focus will readjust itself.- You can adjust the ISO sensitivity from 200 to 1600 and HI-1 and HI-2.  Trust me, it works great with proper use!- White Balance: (the color of light reflected from any object). The white balance makes sure that whites are whites in any given situation instead of coming out a shade of gray.- AF-Assist Eliminator: It helps the camera Auto-focus on a poorly lit subject by sending a beam of light on the subject to help the focussing process.- Memory Buffer: is extremely quick for fast, consecutive shots.- Comfortable to hold in right hand- Fairly Light, depending on the lens used- You can input comments on the monitor, with the keyboard area, to the comment area and attach it to your picture.- All Nikkor lenses are compatible with the D100, depending on the nature of the lens. Some minor adjustments or compensations or different settings may need to occur. (out of focus or manual lens, AF-S, AF-I Nikkor lenses etc&#8230;)- True to life color photosPhoto Manipulation:Each photo, when uploaded to the computer is about 1.5Mb in size.With the use of Photoshop, I usually have to make only minor adjustments to the levels, depending on what needs to be enhanced. With the D100, I&#8217;ve tried taking photos indoors without the flash, but it doesn&#8217;t guarantee clarity unless you crank up the ISO sensitivity, and use the noise reducer. You may find yourself needing to use the flash indoors, more often, because it will most likely result in a blurred or distorted photo. With the D100, I'm able to capture indoor images I've only dreamt of, and didn't need to use slow speeds and a tripod.Our first Nikon was the F1 standard model with a Photomic Head, in 1969. I've had many disappointments with my non-digital Nikon models because of multiple visits to the repairman, resulting in the carbon track in the Photometer being worn out & couldn't be replaced. That would explain why all my photos were always over-exposed. I&#8217;ve always had wrong readings.My partner&#8217;s decision to switch to digital was one of his greatest purchases within the past year, among other things! I suggest you invest in this camera because you won&#8217;t be sorry!</div>

      <div class="reviewText">I started off with the Defender series of Otterbox for my galaxy and though it was excellent at protecting my phone it was just too bulky. I had to constantly take it apart to keep the screen protector part clean as well as my real screen clean. This caused it to get stretched out extremely quickly. Eventually the phone case began to stretch too much and started to fall apart. <mark>The screen protector piece also got pretty cloudy and got scratched pretty easily.I decided to try the commuter series of Otterbox instead and wow am I glad I did.</mark> What a difference! The commuter series cases are much slimmer then the Defender case. I went from struggling to fit my phone in my pockets to having it fit with ease. The case is nice looking, smooth, works well with my ISmooth screen protector (my favorite screen protector), it fits my phone like a glove and on top of that it protects my phone wonderfully. I am accident prone and every time I've dropped my phone its turned out fine. I also do not have to take the case apart now every time I need to clean my screen. This will likely allow the phone case to last a lot longer then my Defender series did.Even if you're not accident prone I highly suggest this case to everyone. It is small, nice looking and protective with a very reasonable price. You just can't beat that!I also suggest to go with the Commuter over the Defender series. The Defender series is really only best for people who have jobs where phones can take a real beating as well as get dirty. Otherwise the Commuter series protects your phone just as well as the Defender series except you get a much more sleek and slim phone case.</div>
      <div class="question">Does it come with screen protector?</div>
      <div class="answer">It comes with a piece of plastic you can use as a screen protector, but it isn't built into the case like it is in the defender cases</div>

When an alert signal is received from the MURS AlertTM transmitter the HT will sound off with the voice of the alert signal and will also display an alert icon as a visual display that an alert signal has been received. This has many different applications for small businesses, farms, security guards, outdoorsmen.

      <div class="reviewText">While researching MURS radios a few years ago, I bought a variety of models, including a pair of these since they had just come onto the market relatively recently.What really irked me the most was that the radio comes with 6 AA NiMH batteries, but they're bottom-of-the-barrel quality batteries (1600mAh?). They don't hold a charge. They get super hot in most rapid chargers. And with the built-in charger, they take forever to charge. (12 hours?<mark>)The antenna is detachable, but I'm not sure what kind of replacement you can use with it.</mark> The volume control was decent, but everything else about the radio felt kinda shoddy. Even the transmit range of this radio vs. the other MURS radios I have is much worse.The radio hasn't fallen apart on me and it's generally usable, so I can't give it only 1 star. So 2 stars it is.</div>
      <div class="question">is the antenna detachable? if so, what is the connector type?</div>
      <div class="answer">Yes, the antenna is, in fact, detachable. It is a standard male/female system that is very solid without overtightening. I picked up some Galati Gear Molle Radio Pouches here on Amazon. They are the best, in my opinion and the molle system works well with my gear.</div>

      <div class="reviewText">I gave the first one to my aunt after using it a number of years. I bought two for my trip to Europe so that I could charge two devices at once. <mark>The device has a built in surge protector with a spare fuse.</mark> This device is well worth the money. It allowed me to charge my European cell phone in the US before my trip.</div>
      <div class="question">Does it come with surge protector?</div>
      <div class="answer">No.</div>
