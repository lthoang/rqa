You and your friends compete to kill monsters and grab magic items. And what magic items. Don the Horny Helmet and the Boots of Butt Kicking. Wield the Staff of Napalm or maybe the Chainsaw of bloody dismemberment. Start by slaughtering the Potted Plant and the Drooling Slime, and work your way up to the Plutonium Dragon. For 3 to 8 players. 60 minutes. Munchkin is a stand alone card game designed by Steve Jackson that "simulates" a fantasy themed RPG in a simple, card based game that's chock full of silliness.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('1556344732')" id="toggleBtn-1556344732">Show more</button>

    <div class="reviewText">I got this for my partner for his birthday. He loves it and was really excited to finally get it. It's a very fun game and entertaining. Half the game is based on chance (good or bad cards) and the other half depends on strategy. There was a lot of going back and forth between who was on top and who was on bottom, which is surprising because in most games there is a clear front-runner.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">We had never heard of this game before we received this game as a gift and we loved it! We have 5 children and it really is not suited for the younger kids. Our 8 year old is really interested in playing, but it is a little hard for her yet. It is our older kids' favorite by far (16, 19 and 21). We have bought many of the "expansion" packs to add to it and have purchased several of the games for Christmas gifts for others. Our boys try to get us to play any chance they get! They also didn't want us to buy it for their older sister because they wanted her to come to "our" house to play. I like the game because it is different every time we play and it can change direction in just a moment, meaning the person winning could get knocked back down to level 1 and the last place person can become the winner! It is fun and keeps the family laughing, conversing and arguing (in fun) the entire time.</div>

    <div class="answerText">It really depends on the number of people and how fast everyone takes turn. Also, the rules can sometimes be up to your interpretation, so it also depends on how much debate happens over that. If you have a focused group I'd say the game would be a lot faster. With my family, games probably do take about an hour.</div>

There are a lot of rules in this game, but once you've read through the rule book (which is, admittedly, a very entertaining read) the game is pretty simple to play. It's a different game every time. I've played this several times now with my husband and several of my siblings and we all love it.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">This game is pretty fun.  It seems like there are a lot of rules, but they are pretty easy to remember once you start playing.  You can play with kids no problem except for my complaint below.My only complaint is that some of the card titles use language that isn't the most appropriate for kids.  My boys are 8 and 11 and I wish a few of them (bad-ass bandana, stoned golem--holding a bong for good measure) weren't in there.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I got this for my partner for his birthday. He loves it and was really excited to finally get it. It's a very fun game and entertaining. Half the game is based on chance (good or bad cards) and the other half depends on strategy. There was a lot of going back and forth between who was on top and who was on bottom, which is surprising because in most games there is a clear front-runner.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">We had never heard of this game before we received this game as a gift and we loved it! We have 5 children and it really is not suited for the younger kids. Our 8 year old is really interested in playing, but it is a little hard for her yet. It is our older kids' favorite by far (16, 19 and 21). We have bought many of the "expansion" packs to add to it and have purchased several of the games for Christmas gifts for others. Our boys try to get us to play any chance they get! They also didn't want us to buy it for their older sister because they wanted her to come to "our" house to play. I like the game because it is different every time we play and it can change direction in just a moment, meaning the person winning could get knocked back down to level 1 and the last place person can become the winner! It is fun and keeps the family laughing, conversing and arguing (in fun) the entire time.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">This is a fun game to play with your kids.  I enjoy it as father playing with my boys.  The cards are funny and the rules aren't too hard to figure out, especially if you review them first then play and review them as you go during the first game.  It is a numbers game.  You have to have the higher combat score to win against monsters to collect treasure cards.  But there are other cards that will allow you to win or give you more points.  There are cards that you put face up which are your character and everything he can hold, then there are face down cards/hand card that you keep secret to play during combat or against other players.  It is fun to play but can be too easy for older kids who may lose interest if they aren't into role playing card games.  If you need a game for an older set of kids, middle school up to 99, you should try The Settlers of Catan.  You will pleasantly surprised by its uniqueness each time you play along with planning and strategy required to win.</div>

This game, while simple in its nature, takes a lot of strategic planning in order to win, as everyone is against each other. Though if a 10 year old got good at it, they would probably really advanced in their processing abilities later in life.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Munchkin has really grown on us. At first it was strange, the rules were odd, and victories felt cheap and unearned. Now that our gaming group has played this dozens of times, we know the ins and outs of what's going to be in the deck. What equipment to look for and what items we could use to prevent the leading player from winning.Wacky and fun, this game can cause arguments to break out. It is a game about trumping your friends when they least expect it, and making alliances with others. There's even an Elf class that will gain a level by helping out a friend in battle.</div>

Some examples are a Broad Sword that only females can use, Crabs as a monster where you discard armor and all items worn below the waist, a Horny Helmet (elf with a helmet with big horns) and snails on speed.  There is a 'curse change sex card' which my 8 year old thinks is funny unless he is the one changed to a girl.  We only  have the first set, so there might be something in one of the other sets.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Fantasy Flight card covers are consistently rated the best you can get by board game and card game junkies all over the world. They are durable, sized better than other brands, and they do their job. No other brand stands up to them. That said, the online cost of them is rather high, so I make this recommendation: check your local gaming store for these! I can't speak for every shop in the country, but where I live you can get these for HALF the price they are selling online at your local gaming or comic book shop. A lot of these places make their money off their merchandise,  not the accessories, so they sell the card sleeves cheap. If your local shop doesn't do it, then go ahead and order here. These are a great product wherever you get them, and I'd rather overpay on these than underpay on junk.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I bought 14 packs of these sleeves to go along with my Lord of the Rings: Living Card game core set plus 6 adventure packs and the Kazad-Dum expansion.I'm very happy with how durable they are, and I appreciate the slick feel so that they are very easy to shuffle. I don't mind that they like to glide right off of each other when stacked. I'd rather my cards were easy to move.Unfortunately, however, I realized quickly as I was sleeving my cards that there were two distinct sizes (lengthwise only, not width) by a small margin. I ended up having to split the sizes between using the taller size for all the player cards, and the shorter size for all of the adventure deck cards.It was a crapshoot every time I opened another pack of 50 whether I'd see the taller or slightly shorter size. All of the packaging was identical (blue), and ten packs came in a sealed container together, so I'm confident I wasn't dealing with two products.Edit: 04/09/12I have revised my previous review from 3 stars to 5 stars. Fantasy Flight was responsive to my issue and far exceeded my expectations in resolving all the problems I had with sizing. I am very happy with my product and I thoroughly recommend this company to everybody.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">These are the perfect size for Love Letter and Resistance.  I like how slick they are and make shuffling very easy.  I had several left over so I decided to sleeve Saboteur role and goal cards.  These are a bit too big for Saboteur, but I wanted to protect the goal cards asap before the gold card got any kind of marking to spot easily.</div>

If you were thinking about getting a new fluxx game i would suggest getting one of the specialty games like pirate fluxx or Monty Python fluxx. That way you could play them separately or mix the decks together.</div>

The Star Trek themed fluxx is a good one that involves character play and even special "powers."

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">09 7, 2012</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I bought this after I saw it on the lineup for TableTop reviews (if you don't know what that is, please go check it out on youtube with Wil Wheaton!), and we have had quite a few fun games with it. It's a pretty simple game that has only 1 rule to start with (draw 2 cards, play 1) and as you play your action cards you begin to modify the rules (draw 4 cards, play 2, hand limit 1) and you even keep changing the requirements for how you win so the game is in constant fluctuation (Fluxx - get it?).It's easy to play, basically a no-brainer to teach considering the rules are never the same for any two games, and it's a little more sophisticated for adults who like to play Uno but get bored of matching colors and numbers. You can easily sabotage your friend who's about to win by abruptly changing a rule and so on goes the game. However, I have played with very competitive people and the games can last a really long time if you're constantly thwarting everyone's efforts to win. But it's always in the airplane bag for long airport waiting times or layovers.Pick it up because it's affordable and just simple enough to be fun for a long time.</div>

    <div class="answerText">I have only played the original version once. However, I did notice a couple changes. First of all, in 4.0 there is a "rules escalation" card, so that every time the deck has to be shuffled during one game then the basic rules "draw one, play one" increase by one. For example, if the deck has to be shuffled once, then the rules escalation changes the basic rules from"draw one, play one" to "draw two, play two". If the deck has to be shuffled a second time during three same game then the basic rules escalate to "draw three, play three" and so on. Also in 4.0, some of the keepers, such as war and taxes, are now called Creepers and can prevent you from winning the game unless there is a silver lining rule card in play, or the creeper is part of a goal card. I don't know of any other differences as I only played the one game and didn't get through the whole deck, but some other things in 4.0 that could possibly be different are as follows:There is a "radioactive potato" that is passed around the table everyone the goal changes when it is in play. If you have the potato card in possession you can't win. However there is also a rule card that can be played that says you must have the potato card to win when you have the keepers that match the goal. There is a "double agenda" card that allows two possible goals to be available at the same time. There is an inflation card and a party bonus card that both increase the number on the cards, similar to the basic rules escalation mentioned above, but they increase any of the rule cards with a number on them, not just the basic rules. Lastly, there is a "first play random" card that requires the player to your left to choose your first play, unless you only have one play at the time according to the rules.As I said, I don't know how much of this is really different, but I hope I helped you decide if it is worth it. A someone else posted, there are always the specialty versions like the Monty Python version (you really need to know your Monty Python skits and songs to do well), martian, pirate, etc...Have fun no matter what you decide.

    <div class="reviewText">This is the 10th time I have ordered Fluxx 4.0.  It's not that there is anything wrong with it, but rather I invite family and friends over to play and they end up loving the game so much I send it home with them. This is definitely my family's favorite game from the 8 year old to the 86 year old and everybody in between. My 86 year-old dad loves it because it helps him exercise his brain. The games you play are like snowflakes, no two games are the same. Some games have lasted only 5-10 minutes while others we've had to shuffle through the deck three or four times and lasted for over an hour.  The beginning of the game is the same with the number of cards you start with and the first play is draw one, play one, after that you never know what is going to happen. The other thing that is the same every time is that we always have fun and end up laughing a lot.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">This game is great. Very much what I've come to expect from Looney Labs. I started off with Chrononauts, which is a somewhat complex game--certainly not one for the monosyllabic.Fluxx is a little more straightforward, but its always changing. This game starts off simple- Draw one card, play one card, pass to the next player. Then, players can play additional rules, changing the game. Now maybe you draw 4 cards, and perhaps you must play 2 each turn? Hand limits now? You never know what will happen next!There are goals, but those goals often change throughout the game. You may think you're one card away from winning it all, and in the blink of an eye and the play of one card, you've handed the game to an opponent.Love this game, great for 2 players or more. Also try out some of the other versions. I've played zombie fluxx and eco fluxx, and will probably grab a few more for the holidays this season.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">This became a quick favorite. The first game we played took the whole of 2 or 3 hours by playing one very silly card that made it nearly impossible to win. It can take much less than that. Call it 15 minutes on the low side, 45 average. The game constantly changes in the most delightful way. Everyone always feels relevant, and it's hard to hold a grudge against a winner.</div>

I would suggest getting Family Fluxx first to get kids used to the rules and then moving on to this one.  Family Fluxx is a bit more friendly ... no Creepers.  You'll just have to buy the game to see what bad things Creepers are and can do ... but they can help you too!  ;)  We have the Monty Python version but haven't played it yet.  We keep going back to this one!  You never get the same hand twice!  The replay value is excellent and it doesn't take up much room to store it!</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Fluxx is a game in which the 'rules' constantly change. Each turn consists of drawing card(s) and playing card(s). You play certain 'keeper' cards in front of you, and if you have the correct combination of keepers that match the current goal. Of course, you can change the goal, or the keepers you have, or any of the rules depending upon what cards you have.Two downsides to this game- you have to read every card, which is difficult for people who are unused to games like this, and it's just complicated enough of a game that some people cannot play. (My mom cannot really play this game.)</div>

We have Family Fluxx (safe for visitors to play), Monty Python (a bit adult), Zombie (kids love it and it has a real mean streak in it) and regular Fluxx (visitor safe also but larger than Family Fluxx).  It is the same basic rules so if you can play one then you can play any of them.  Family Fluxx does not have "Creepers".  If you play the cards right you can steal keepers you need from other players, discard goals you  know they could use to win and other little sneaky tricks to make the game last longer and to keep others from beating you.  All of them are great fun!  Our 9 year olds play all by Monty Python and love them.

    <div class="reviewText">Account holders wife here giving the review!  The kids (8 and 9 years old) and I play this all the time!  It is great!  I would suggest getting Family Fluxx first to get kids used to the rules and then moving on to this one.  Family Fluxx is a bit more friendly ... no Creepers.  You'll just have to buy the game to see what bad things Creepers are and can do ... but they can help you too!  ;)  We have the Monty Python version but haven't played it yet.  We keep going back to this one!  You never get the same hand twice!  The replay value is excellent and it doesn't take up much room to store it!</div>

      <div class="reviewTime">02 3, 2014</div>
    </div>
    <div class="reviewText">I love the Fluxx series so much, and you can't go wrong with the original!Fluxx is the perfect go-to game if you want something fast-paced, fun and easy to learn.  Because the explanation and basic rules of the game are so simple, I've found that it's equally fun for brand-new players as for those who've played it before.  Everything is explained on each card, so you can give very minimal instructions to new players and they'll pick it up easily.  We usually use this as a warm-up game on game nights with friends and family, before moving on to more strategy-based games.Since I mentioned strategy, I will give you one word of caution: this is not a game for those who are looking for something with elaborate strategy and get frustrated when the plan they've been working on for several rounds either doesn't work out or backfires.  The nature of the game is to be ever-changing, so you have to be willing to go with the flow.  You can have some strategy, of course, but you have to be willing to see it blow up in front of you in seconds--and then laugh about it!A word about the theme versions of the game: I own several of the other versions (Monty Python Fluxx, Star Fluxx, Oz Fluxx, Zombie Fluxx), and this is the version I play with either new players or when I have a mixed group of people in terms of their familiarity with some of the other themes.  Monty Python Fluxx, for example, is best played by a group of MP lovers--this can be played by anyone, and they'll get the references and the humor!</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Out of the box one channel didn't work -left rudder. Since I had purchased this to learn the skills for my first rc plane I tried to repair it. Nothing looked loose or undone inside of it, so ordered a new one and requested refund for this one. But only printed out the return order and postage, and kept using this broken one till the new one showed up then I would mail this one back for refund. Well the new one never showed and amazon gave me a refund for that one.So ordered a 6 channel from ebay for 1/2 price of this one that I now am putting in the mail because my window to receive the refund in drawing close. The FMS software is ok and will get you started but if you are willing to spend a another $39 go find clearview on the net. Fms is hard to run on vista but was able to do it by looking on the web. I would save your time and go with clearview.</div>

The graphics are very basic, and installation on Windows 8.1 laptop required copy/paste of an older graphics dll, but the airplane sim is great, the controller works very well, and I was able to train in order to be able to fly a Mini Switch RTF without crashing it, which was my goal.Great product.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I purchased this for my 9 year old son before I go out and spend big bucks on a real RC plane.  As expected, he took right to it.  It seems to be fairly 'realistic' in nature and he is learning some of the basics of RC planes.  He can take the planes out and back, which I have a very hard time doing as 100% of the time, I crash.  I hope the practice for him will translate into a 0% fatality rate for RC planes.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">The software worked on my computer; it's running Windows 7 64-bit. I don't really like it that much, so I'm using the Clearview SE simulator that I found free online. I never found any uses for the 5th and 6th channel which are the knobs which is a bummer. The software that I was using didn't even pick up on the 6th channel as I believe it's broken (I bought this as new). I kind of wish they made it closer to the Spectrum controllers, but I guess cheap is cheap I suppose. It did help me prepare myself for flying 4 channel airplanes, but nothing comes close to the real thing. It gave me inspiration and the confidence to go ahead and buy the micro Trojan and micro Mustang along with the DX6i remote on eBay.If you want to start flying four channel planes, I recommend starting here first. After here, decide if you want to buy a luxury simulator or use that same amount of money to buy a RTF plane... Your choice I suppose.</div>

There are several other free programs that might work if you search for "Flight Simulators." All of the ones that I have tried are truly terrible to figure out due to the lack of any real instructions. If you find a good one you should post it in a review.</div>

I had to find a missing &#34;DLL&#34; file on the internet to even try using the system. After that, none of the helicopter simulations would work so I contacted the company.

That was a feat in itself considering the terrible instructions. I think that you could do the same thing if you had a 2 stick game controller of any type that hooks to your computer.

    <div class="reviewText">Considering it's been a long time since I used a r/c tr I thought I should try this first before getting back into the fun. If your not very comfortable with program set up This might not be a good choice. Absolutely no instructions. The good people who posted reviews here are valuable sources to help you set it up so its usable. Thanks everyone.Once it's set up its fair enough for the price. I used to have Great planes but the disks were stolen long ago. It's a lot more expensive and it shows. The free soft ware on the disk would not load. I down loaded from the Internet and after a few flights it stops. I think it's 35.00 to buy the software.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">If you are interested in learning to fly a radio-controlled (R/C) airplane or helicopter, this is the most complete yet inexpensive way to try it out. The item contains a controller (the gadget you use to tell the plane where to fly) and the simulator software. The controller just plugs into your PC USB port. Load the software from the CD and off you go! Be sure to go to the Controller menu and calibrate the controller before you try to fly. You will have to reverse several of the controls and re-assign the throttle control to the proper control stick.The software is FMS, public-domain software that has not been upgraded in several years. There are hundreds of plane "models" for this software posted around the web.Considering that this competes with several commercial packages that list at $200-$300, it does an OK job. The big problem is that the simulator makes flying too easy. If you go to the field having only flown this software you will find the "real world" flight much more challenging. Also, the "world" in this simulator is very small. You will fly "out of the world" very quickly. The R/C airplane you fly in "the real world" can cost several hundred dollards, so if this saves you one crash it has paid for itself.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Out of the box one channel didn't work -left rudder. Since I had purchased this to learn the skills for my first rc plane I tried to repair it. Nothing looked loose or undone inside of it, so ordered a new one and requested refund for this one. But only printed out the return order and postage, and kept using this broken one till the new one showed up then I would mail this one back for refund. Well the new one never showed and amazon gave me a refund for that one.So ordered a 6 channel from ebay for 1/2 price of this one that I now am putting in the mail because my window to receive the refund in drawing close. The FMS software is ok and will get you started but if you are willing to spend a another $39 go find clearview on the net. Fms is hard to run on vista but was able to do it by looking on the web. I would save your time and go with clearview.</div>

Designed with simplicity in mind, it is light weight and its flight characteristics benefit from this design feature. Constructed of durable materials and graphite booms the light weight enhances the crafts power to weight ratio. The 4 rotors are driven by 4 motors protected in plastic housings. The rotors are also gear driven which relieves the stress on the motors. The rotor blades are also protected by a molded foam shell that absorbs impacts and protects the blades during collisions with obstacles. The V262 handles exceptionally well. With the help of an on board gyro and adjustable control sensitivity, the V262 is perfect for pilots of different skill level and ages. This drone is agile, and it has the ability to do flips and tricks. With the push of a button on the transmitter the aircraft enter "trick mode" allowing the pilot to do flips and rolls. The WL Toys V262 transmitter features a 2.4ghz radio system. This means you don't have to worry about signal interference and you have the ability to fly many of these at one time.WL Toys V262 Specification:Brand Name: WL ToysItem No: V262Channel: 4CHGyro: 6 axisFlight Duration: 8-10 MinutesRemote Control Distance: 100-150 MetersRecharging Time: 1-1.5 HoursBattery For Quadcopter: 7.4V 850 mAhBattery For Transmitter: 6 x AA Battery (not included)Quadcopter Size: about 55 x 55 x 5cmPackage Includes:1 x WL Toys V262 RC Quadcopter1 x transmitter1 x battery1 x charger4 x spare propeller**Required to Fly:**6 AA Batteries for Transmitter</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('9269803716')" id="toggleBtn-9269803716">Show more</button>

    <div class="answerText">I have not weighed it but it is much lighter that the package.  It is big and bulky due to blade protector ring and the packaging weighs more that the quad by a lot.  Many people remove the protector after their flying skills improve (I am not there yet) because the motor has a short life with the total weight and does much better when the shield is removed.  Up to you of course.  Good luck, Doug</div>

    <div class="reviewText">This is my son's toy - I tested it..:)So far so good. Powerful enough to withstand light wind. I would recommend this, but I only used it once because of a Christmas gift. After confused by the manual, I decided to "just fly it and learn." This is what I found:Quadcopter-The two white LED is the front. (I found this extremely Important)The left stick on the controller is for lift-off (accelerate/up and decelerate/down). Move it to left or right ONLY ROTATE the quadcopter V262. It DOES NOT fly or move while hovering.The right stick is only for SHIFTING/TILTING: left, right, back, and forward and WILL fly/move to that direction until you let go the stick. Then it just hovers in the air.To have more fun, use both sticks...once you are familiar with the control.Controller-The 40, 60,80, and 100% buttons correspond to the "sharpness" of the SHIFTINGS/TILTING.The higher the percentage, the sharper of the tilt. I recommend to start at 40% (unsure if that is what it does. I based this on observations only)The controller screen shows all adjustments of the quadcopter. All my settings are in the middle. It hovers without rotating, shifting, or accelerating/lifting. (Luckly, mine came that way). If yours shift or rotate to one side, slide the slider/tab to the opposite to the direction until it correct itself. All four adjustment slider/tab are placed correspond to the what you need to do. Page 4 on manual. I recommend adjusting/trimming the hovering first. (The left Lift-off stick)Top right corner front button on the controller is for stunt flip. Only perform when quadcopter is at least 15 feet off the ground. It was an accident when I did it. Gave me a fright. The stunt needs at least 4 feet dropTakes about one full hour to charge. 10 minutes of non stop flyingPlay outdoor unless you have a large indoor room or an experience flyer.Note: I did not use terms like rudder, elevator, crab, throttle, or aileron. I just want it to be simple. Apologized to all the non-novice flyers.Pros - powerful and ready to fly after charging. Construction and material seems strong enough for minor crashes.Cons - the manual IS really bad. Small prints. Made in China so the instruction manual is a bit confusing for me. My manual is for model V959 but I purchased V262.???? And the manual called it Quadrocopter not Quadcopter.You need a large space like a park with no trees around unless you are an experience flyer. I'm not...Will update againUpdate: 12/29/13  Charged for the 5th time. So far consistent on the time it takes to charge. 1 hr and 20 minutes. Correction on theflight time. Only 8 minutes 20 seconds of continuous flight not 10 as stated on previous post. Few flips, lots of turns and shifts.Good 40% in full throttle going up. Constant use of both sticks at the same time.My last flight lasted 9 minutes and 12 seconds. Why?  I turned off the LED lights and I flew it about 30/40 feet off the ground. Mostlythe use of the right stick shifting/rotation and very few lifts. (still fun but not as cool)I decided to use Gorilla Glue to "anchor" the connection (female end blk/red) wires to the circuit board. The connection wiresrequired a lot of movement to connect to the battery. Way too much "play" on the soldering. Now the first half inch wires from thesoldering doesn't move. I can turn it any way I see fit. (This is my opinion only. It is NOT required).Note: The quadcopter will descend (from what I noticed) by itself when battery is low. I can't guarantee that when it is way up high.So after about 8 minutes of fun, stay low and close. I continue to give a good "Recommend" 4 stars.Will update after 10 more flights. And try the 1000Mah battery.Update: 01/10/14 charge time and flight time remain consistent. Crashed onto grass a few times (tumbling) No damage yet. Pretty durable so far; on grassed park with few trees. One of the main anchor to the styrofoam is loose. It is from bad landing. I powered down too quickly while quadcopter still a bit high. Oops!I read many reviews and I do agree with some of those issues. The motors are hot after the 8-9 minutes of flights, but not enough to remove my fingers. (How hard you push the quadcopter at max speed plays a big role in my opinion)So far I have 12 total flights and no issues yet. (My second v262  has 4 flights)The 1000MAh battery gave me extra 2 minutes. Due to the reviews, (overheating the motors) I would not push the quadcopter at full throttle 75% of the flight due to longer flight time with this battery. This is my opinion of course.  My flight patterns are mostly below 75% power and few quick burst at 100%. I drop to 20-25% power when gliding down from up high (trying to conserve battery and possibility of cooling the motor.) Save your money. Not worth it for extra 2 minutes. It also too big (I knew this before purchase)to fit into the original battery compartment.I watched some videos where a camera was attached and it shows the whole neighborhood 5-6 blocks away. So I tried it (95% throttle power) AND yes it can go high; to the point that I was unable to tell if it was moving. (It started to beep) I throttled down to 20% and watched it slide/drop back down. (I performed this after a full/fresh battery installed. Don't do this after a flight, otherwise you might not have enough power to recover from the high slide/drop)I now have my own quadcopters V262. My 12yrs old son and I fly it together, chasing each other with the quadcopters, (not recommend, It will hurt if the propeller/s touch your head) gliding back and forth, dodging, (also not recommend, it hurts) herding my dog back, (not recommend, might hurt the dog) ect. Binding seems to take longer on mine. Construction was solid. The charger block is different. Otherwise everything is exactly like my son's v262.I continue to RECOMMEND the v262 quadcopter still only 4 stars. I would give 5 stars if I can use it 100% throttle for most of my flights without worrying about over heating the motors. As long as you don't push it to full throttle, drop landing, and not crash into trees, the v262 should last. This is my last review unless something serious. Have fun flying!</div>

    <div class="reviewText">The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it only lasted about 150 flights before a motor went out. As for flying the quad , it's a lot of fun and takes a lot of abuse. It is very easy to fly as well and I have never flown anything before.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">There are a ton of youtube videos and channels dedicated to quadcopters and this model in particular. I ended up burning one of the motors up the 2nd day I had it though because apparently I didn't break in the motors. All in all this is a fantastic quadcopter and is really loads of fun! I can't wait to fly mine again but the 2-3 week wait on parts from Hong Kong is a bummer.</div>

    <div class="answerText">It hasn't been used since last fall. I contacted my grandson who told me it still charges up (after 2 years of massive abuse) but the battery runs down in no time. He claims he has had it run as far as 'Kevs house' which is probably 5 city lots down the street. So I would estimate at 40 foot per lot, then 200 feet would be about right. I'm amazed that the thing still exists, given his ability to destroy anything not made of 1/4" steel plate. It'll probably need batteries this spring or a complete rebuild. Maybe his father could reach into his pocket and cover that? hope that helps.</div>

    <div class="answerText">Thats a tough one IMO, its made of light plastic so it's safe in that aspect but the blades do spin quite fast. Would really only be a problem if it were to hit one of his eyes. It does take some practice and patience to fly correctly. With out trying to sound rude, it's possible the child may either break the item in a short period of time or lose patience trying to get to fly right. It really depends on the child and thier capabilities at that particular age. I hope this helped!</div>

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">06 30, 2013</div>
    </div>
    <div class="reviewText">This Hero H911 is an amaizing little bird! I had a couple 3ch helis last year and while fun the excitement faded after a couple months of use. It was a great place to start and glad I had the oportunity to do that to really appreciate this 4ch unit. Recently I got the itch to fly another RC heli and started to do some research. Just like you I ran across this killer little toy and knew I had to have it! The added 4th channel over the 3ch units I have used makes this heli loads of fun! If you have owned/operated a 3 ch model this will be a bit easier to master but I can safely say that a complete beginner can operate the H911 with a little bit of practice & patience. I cant stress how much bang you get for the buck. Both the controller and heli are very well built with good quality materials. The heli is pretty darn tough! Ive hit the walls and dropped from 6-8ft onto hard wood floors several times and this sucker just keeps on going. Yes you can hover this fairly easily and yes you can avoid walls but to me thats no fun, heheh, I like to push it to the extremes and try entertaining manuevers, fly through different rooms, attenpt fitting through small areas and best of all annoying the heck out of the cat! It does come with some spare parts to replace commonly broken pieces and does have 2 batteries to aid the flight time. For some reason, mine came with 130mah batteries like the V911 (as opposed to 180mah like other places selling I have viewed) but they work fine. I did opt for a couple of the 200mah batteries that I found rather affordable online to get a little more extended flight time. Its a great means of relaxation and unloading my work stress during the week. If your on the fence for any reason, dont be, order it. You will be very satisfied. Those leaving less than high ratings either were unfortunate enough to recieve a defective item or just expect to be an expert in minutes without the need for practice (wich would take the fun out of it if it were that easy in my opinion)!Edit 7/16/13: Still love this heli as much as day 1. I have even flown it outside in light wind a few times (you can search on youtube "h911 outdoor flight in wind" and see a couple vids I posted up) with great success. I do want to point out that some are posting an "upgraded swash plate" comes on the H911 wich is only somewhat true. It IS upgraded over the "old, original" V911 swash (I mean early production) but the swash on the H911 is the same as what you get on the V911 (v2) that has the newer battery connection available online today. Outside of some places offering the 180mah batteries with the H911 for a few minutes more of flight time, the only thing that makes this better (to some) is the Warbird canopy as it appears to be a limited production canopy. I do love it and wish I had ordered a V911 canopy to preserve the Warbird canopy but who wants to fly around on thier $50 heli without the cool Warbird face on it? Not me! Still cant say enough good things about this heli!</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I started with a Syma S107 and learned the basics of flying a heli. This helicopter is the perfect step up from that. It flies well inside, but you will want more room than with the S107. This heli is much more fun outside in light or no wind. It has two modes that switch at the push of a button on the radio. Mode 1 is great for getting used to the heli and mode 2 will make all the controls quicker as the servos are able to extend further. It is very durable, but you will want to buy an extra set of blades and a couple of connect buckle sets (attach the swash plate to blade to balance bar.) You will also want to get an some more batteries (I got ones that were larger than the stock batteries.) These parts are cheap, like another $20 or so. I looked at several heli's and decided on this one. For $55 or so it is a great deal.</div>

Like the V911, it has two settings, beginner, which is fast, and advanced, that is blazing! You can't go wrong buying this 'copter, no matter what level pilot you are! I also want to give a shout out to Amazon's customer service...they rock! I ordered this copter on the 15th...received on the 16th!!! You can't beat that kind of service, AND, Amazon stands behind their products! Again, this copter is well worth the price, is genuinely tough, and hard to break! Get yours TODAY!!! You might be able to find the H911 for a little less on a different site, but with Amazon's customer service, you'd be crazy not to purchase from them...I always check other sites when I am ready to purchase another 'copter, but I always come back to Amazon...You just can't beat them for service, and courtesy to their customers!!</div>

    <div class="reviewText">This little H911 it truly worth every cent. Great entry level single rotor heli. Very stable and forgiving. However if you have mastered your coaxial then this probably won't keep your attention for long. Faster,  more nimble, and requiring some more stick and rudder input, it won't be long before you're zipping around the living room and kitchen blowing out candles. If you think you are ready for something a little more challenging, I would drop my extra pennies on the msr, msr x or even the honey bee V3  If you are feeling like you're a natural. Anywho this is a great heli for buzzing around the house, and at the price is definitely worth the fun. &#34;Fly slow and fly fast but power down before you crash.&#34;</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I've purchased a few remote control heli's over the past few years and I'd have to say that this by far is the best one!  The price is fantastic on this helicopter considering what it does.  Control is amazing!  Durability is very good as well.  I've had a few indoor/outdoor crashes, nothing crazy, and the only part that tends to break are the large blades.  This really isn't such a big deal because there are several retailers right here on Amazon that sell replacements.  Replacing them is a 15 minute job, but gets easier after you do it a few times.  I would definitely advise you to buy a few spares.  Other than the large blades nothing had broken on mine.  My only complaint, if you can really call it that, is that I can't find an exact replacement for the canopy.  It tends to get banged up a bit, and I'd like to get a brand new one.  I would absolutely tell you to pick up this heli without hesitation.  I haven't had any personal contact with the seller, but I can say that it arrived quickly and in perfect shape.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">compared to the Syma 107s this thing is hard to fly. Its very fast, good signal, and seems tough. It does not fly good in the wind and its seems hard to get it completely trimmed out. With that said I think it will be a lot of fun when I learn to fly bit better. Its still fun, just hard to fly.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">This little heli bound to my tx with no prob and seems to be deceptively bullet proof! As flimsy as this heli looks, it has bashed into walls, the floor, a table and had about a 7' fall onto the blacktop and hasn't broke not one part! I'm serious, this thing can survive a novices learning process with resilience and steadfast durability. The only problem that I have with this bad to the bone bundle of fun is that I cant seem to fly it enough! This helicopter is addictive and provides a fun filled challenging flight that will make the young and old alike smile for days!</div>

With the 2.4GHz technology, you won't have to worry about the two transmitters interfering with each other.  The trick is to not "Bind" or turn on both R/C Helicopters at the same time.  Example:  Helicopter#1 - turn on transmitter and then insert battery and wait for a solid red light on the Helicopter; then it's ready to go.  Helicopter#2 - Bind this Helicopter the same way as #1.

    <div class="reviewText">Wanted a fixed pitch flybarred ultra micro RC Heli to fly around the house for enjoyment and although I've tried other brands, this Hero RC H911 is by far the best to date.  Included transmitter and extra spares ensures it'll be flying for some time in my fleet.The Hero RC H911 cost way less than a BLADE mSR and flies so much better than either the mSR or mSRX, which has required some (expensive) aftermarket parts to get them to come close to measuring up to the stability and flyability of the Hero RC H911.  Packaging was Excellent and all parts & extra's were there (main & tail blades, flybar, linkages).  Outstanding canopy design and paint on this Heli, as well.Once recieved, I looked the whole kit over and had a Lipo (battery) charging while I did so.  Binding this Heli to the included transmitter went without a hitch; I did this even though the H911 may have been binded to the transmitter already from the factory, out of habit.  Checked all the range of motion of the swash plate to ensure it moved the same direction as the transmitter inputs.  A bit of throttle and the H911 was in the air.  After spending a minute or so trimming both the Aileron & Elevator via the transmitter, this Heli will hover hands off for a bit of time.  Piro's were so much better than the one's a mSR can do and flying is smooth and controlled without any major oscillations once the cyclic stick returns to center.Because I also fly larger Collective Pitched Helis, I do wish the transmitter had a configurable timer on it, so as to not out fly the Lipo's capacity.  This can damage a Lipo over time.Overall, I'm really happy with the Hero RC H911 and Impressed.  A great Heli to fly indoors when the weather is not so great or when I don't want to practice 3d with my other ultra micro CP Helis.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">If you are looking for a quick and short answer, then I'd say YES, buy it. Now if you have time and want to know a little about my RC heli flying experience then read on. I started flying the RC heli with an indoor, toy-grade, 3/3.5-channel, infra-red (The sun light will interfere with infra-red), coaxial (2 sets of main rotor/blades) model. It's cheap, slow, and stable, but less responsive to the control, and the fact that it needs a 20~30 minute charging time for every 3~4 minutes of play is just a pain in you know what. After I became pretty good at it (Also tired of it), I got crazy. I moved up to a 450 class 6-channel collective pitch single rotor model, which was a huge mistake. It's like from playing with a harmless toy to an upside-down lawn mower! It was a money pit! Every crash (Usually happened in 10 seconds after take-off) would cost me at least $10~$20 for parts and lots of time trying to repair and adjust it myself. Stepping from a 3.5-channel model to a 6-channel one is a big step. If you think you are a born RC heli generous, then I congratulate you. As for the rest of us, it will crash, again, and again, and... I don't know it's the fact that I ran out of patience or I almost chopped off my fingers, but my money is definitely running out. So I sold the remaining of the chopper on eBay and completely gave up flying RC heli. About 8 months later, I came across the V911 single rotor indoor/outdoor with gyro model made by WL Toys (I think it's a 100 class), and saw nothing but positive reviews. Of course I was skeptical this time after I got burned by the big chopper. But considering 1, the kit (RTF- Ready to fly) is still inexpensive; 2. It's not a lawn mower, so I went for it. Boy I tell ya, I am so happy that I made the decision. I have so much fun with this little buzzer. Oh, by the way, I bought the H911 version because the canopy looks so much cooler.The gyro works. It's mentioned in the instruction, but I'll say it again. You need to set the heli on a leveled surface as soon as you insert the battery, because it will initialize the gyro right after that and uses it as the "base" meaning the heli will always try to return to this position during flight until next initialization. So imagine the heli's "base" is in a tilted position... Not fun! Fly indoor first if the space is big enough, or fly outside when there is NO WIND during your leaning period. I'd still call it a toy, but there is still a little bit of learning curve, because the heli is very agile and the control is very sensitive compared to the indoor infra-red 3.5-channel model. If the gyro is initialized correctly then it should hover pretty easily. After some trimming, it will hover by itself, and then you will have some serious fun! Remember, crashing is inevitable, at least for me, so practice practice and practice. This little bird can take some `unintentional beatings'. There are a lot of cheap replacement parts you can on eBay, so don't worry about your wallet being too shallow. Some personal advice: I'd buy another charger and some high capacity (200 mah) batteries to allow more, if not continuous, flying time. I also bought a few replacement canopies and replaced the original one before I destroy it. The shark face is just too cool!That's all. I hope that would help you making the final decision. Any comment is welcome. Thanks for reading.</div>

The amount of minaturized hardware (gyros, servos, etc.) on this small bird really astounds. Once you've mastered a Syma 107G you can step up to this Heli and master 4 channel fixed pitch flight. Hovers and flies right out of the box. Great packaging and a good instruction manual. Extra parts and two 180 MA batteries for 7-8 minute flights x 2. Well made and detailed. Super value.

    <div class="reviewText">I love this helicopter. I have one of the $20 helicopters that uses infrared and its been great fun indoors but I wanted something i could fly outdoors. There is definitely a learning curve so this should be bought as the next step up from the indoor ones as you can apply all those skills. Highlights are the numerous ways to "dial it in" from the controls, the speed, the cool bank turns and the durability. It also has two modes which allows you to take things slow at first. My only complaint is i wish the led light was on the outside as night time is great to practice due to no winds but its disappears at certain angles. I'm still giving it 5 stars though as it is challenging yet loads of fun. This purchase should be a no brainier and it's extra cool that it included spare parts.</div>

    <div class="answerText">This is indeed remote controlled. Whether or not it is appropriate for a 12 year old depends entirely on the 12 year old. If they have any experience with a remote controlled helicopter before, then this would be a fine gift for them. If they have no such experience but enjoy the challenge of mastering a new skill and have a great deal of patience then this may also be a good gift. If they have no RC experience and don't handle crashes well, I would suggest a coaxial 3-channel helicopter instead. They are much easier to fly, though this will be more rewarding if and when it is mastered.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I bought this helicopter from another website but I want to share my review here for anybody who's looking.I've had this heli for about half a year now. I fly it almost entirely indoors, in my little apartment. It's small enough to fly safely inside without worrying about breaking things. Although it does scuff the walls up a bit if the blades hit them. I used to think the all-metal designs were the best, but this one has convinced me otherwise. It's much lighter than a metal heli, and it withstands crashes that would destroy other copters.It has two holes in the servo arms that you can connect the control rods to. I would definitely suggest moving them to the inner hole for beginning or indoor flight. It is much slower and more controllable that way. It also has a button on the transmitter that controls the turn sensitivity. It says mode 1 and mode 2 but it's really just turn speed.Outside is where this thing really shines, because you need space to take advantage of its speed. Just don't try to fly it in the wind. If the wind is strong enough to feel, it will toss this thing around like the toy it is.I absolutely love that there are two batteries and they are removable for charging. Twice the fly time means twice the fun.Overall, this thing is way more than fifty dollars worth of fun. If you want a beginning four channel helicopter, this is the one.</div>

    <div class="answerText">Yes, it's radio controlled. As for the suitability for a 12 year old I'd have to say that these are difficult to to learn on. My suggestion is to start by learning to master a coaxial infrared remote controlled copter like the Syma S108G. They can be flown indoors and are the best way to learn the basics of remote controlled flying. Trust me... there's a big learning curve to mastering these birds.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">This is the copter to buy if you're ready to graduate from a 3 channel indoor bird. The 2.4 Ghz radio control allows outdoor as well as indoor flight. Super responsive and a real gas to fly. Check out some U-tube videos... Be sure to get the extra 200 mah batteries for longer flying times (you're definitely going to want more flying time), and a spare parts bag because you'll no doubt break some main rotor blades. Other than that, this copter is very durable, enduring crashes very well as long as you back off of the throttle before impact. Have fun!</div>

    <div class="answerText">Yes it is remote control.  I looked at several others and noted that a lot of them were not built for flying outdoors but this one was and it flew amazingly well.  I bought it for my grandsons' 6th birthday and he could fly it just fine.  When he suggested that grandma fly it, she crashed it but nothing broke.  I was really quite surprised with it especially for the price.  Hope this helps</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I started with a Syma S107 and learned the basics of flying a heli. This helicopter is the perfect step up from that. It flies well inside, but you will want more room than with the S107. This heli is much more fun outside in light or no wind. It has two modes that switch at the push of a button on the radio. Mode 1 is great for getting used to the heli and mode 2 will make all the controls quicker as the servos are able to extend further. It is very durable, but you will want to buy an extra set of blades and a couple of connect buckle sets (attach the swash plate to blade to balance bar.) You will also want to get an some more batteries (I got ones that were larger than the stock batteries.) These parts are cheap, like another $20 or so. I looked at several heli's and decided on this one. For $55 or so it is a great deal.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I've purchased a few remote control heli's over the past few years and I'd have to say that this by far is the best one!  The price is fantastic on this helicopter considering what it does.  Control is amazing!  Durability is very good as well.  I've had a few indoor/outdoor crashes, nothing crazy, and the only part that tends to break are the large blades.  This really isn't such a big deal because there are several retailers right here on Amazon that sell replacements.  Replacing them is a 15 minute job, but gets easier after you do it a few times.  I would definitely advise you to buy a few spares.  Other than the large blades nothing had broken on mine.  My only complaint, if you can really call it that, is that I can't find an exact replacement for the canopy.  It tends to get banged up a bit, and I'd like to get a brand new one.  I would absolutely tell you to pick up this heli without hesitation.  I haven't had any personal contact with the seller, but I can say that it arrived quickly and in perfect shape.</div>

I did some small jumping with it and gunned it across open grass. Although I accidentally drove it into a good sized puddle the servos still work fine, Just wiped the water off and packed it away.Note: The only issue I see with this truck, Is where the manufacturer positioned the fuel line too close to thegear box, the metal gears have potential of cutting the fuel line causing a gas leak. That being said, The fuel linemay need to be shortened</div>

      <p>Build a better mousetrap? We dare you. Naturally, the object is to trap mice in the mousetrap, while<span id="dots-B00000DMFD">...</span><span id="more-B00000DMFD" style="display:none"> avoiding getting trapped. By rolling the die, you proceed around the game board, collecting cheese pieces and building a mousetrap bit by bit. Once complete, you set the wheels in motion, as it were, to try to capture the opposition's mice. But this is no ordinary trap. With this contraption you start by turning the crank, that rotates the gears, that push the lever, that moves the shoe, that kicks the bucket, that sends the ball down the stairs and into the gutter, that leads to the rod that releases a second ball, that falls through the bathtub and onto the springboard, that catapults the diver into the washtub, that causes the cage to fall and--whew!--hopefully, capture a mouse. The last "mouse" left uncaptured wins--Alison Golder</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B00000DMFD')" id="toggleBtn-B00000DMFD">Show more</button>

    <div class="answerText">the instructions are in the box.  You roll the dice, move your piece around the board.  Almost every time you land you build a part of the mouse trap.  Once it's complete you can launch the trap and try to catch the other players to win.  Hope that helps!</div>

    <div class="answerText">This is played like a traditional board game, where you roll the dice and advance your player.  You get pulled forward or pushed back based on where you land.  To add to this, you are constructing a complex mouse trap on top of the board at the same time, one piece at a time.  When conditions are right, you are able to run a round weight through the trap and possibly catch an opponent to make them lose the game.  It's a fun game for everyone.</div>

    <div class="answerText">Sort of.  One person could certainly play through in the building of it, but at the end, once the mousetrap is built, the way you win is to trap your opponent's mouse.  But if you just want to build it and set off the mousetrap you could certainly do that.  My six year old loves doing that once we've finished the game.  He even likes setting off the mousetrap while it's being built.</div>

This problem took away all the fun.  We probably should contact the manufacturer and get a replacement.

    <div class="reviewText">This is mouse trap. It is fun and fairly simple to play, but younger children will need help assembling the trap. I think the origianl I played when I was little was a little more sturdy, and they replaced the big yellow ball with a small metal ball that I think doesn't work as well, but then that is kind of part of the game.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Still the quality brand name Radio Flyer that it's been since my childhood. Brings back a flood of memories. Our Rector asked if anyone had a little red wagon that could be used to bring up the offertory gifts during our Eucharistic service. No old wagons available so I set about finding a classic red wagon. Radio Flyer to the rescue. Found exactly what we needed on Amazon. Arrived on schedule and was easy to assemble.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">We have started a new tradition of giving our nieces and nephews what we call  &#34;The Dick and Jane Little Red Wagon&#34; as a present on their third birthdays.  Call it nostalgia, or whatever.  Unfortunately, we had a very difficult time finding this particular model.  We were adamant about finding a metal one, you know, the one from the Dick and Jane readers of our youth.  We were able to find one at Walmart, but it had to be ordered and wouldn't arrive until the following Friday.  We would need to pick it up at the store and then assemble it.  When telling a friend about this, she suggested ordering it from Amazon, which should be re-named, Amazin', because we were able to get the exact same model at the same price, and have it shipped directly to the birthday boy's house! Plus, no delivery charge, no tax and it arrived in two days,instead of 5! From now on, Amazon will be the first place I look.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">It has the classic look ... it makes people smile when I walk by with my grandchildren riding in the back.  But...Sadly it is like so many things that have declined in value and quality over the years.  My brothers and I kicked the heckout of a tougher version, riding, racing and crashing until the red paint had faded and the name was scratched off.  Ourswas made in Chicago and was built to take a good lickin'.The new version from China bends the first time you put a load in it.  This wagon will need to be treated gently or it won'tlast long.  The deck in mine already has pings in it like hail marks on the roof of a car.  Perhaps we will make a nicenostalgia garden, planting flowers in the back this coming spring.  If you're big on memories there is a smaller versionavailable that will sit safely on a shelf out of harms way. :)</div>

      <div class="reviewTime">11 7, 2013</div>

    <div class="reviewText">We have started a new tradition of giving our nieces and nephews what we call  &#34;The Dick and Jane Little Red Wagon&#34; as a present on their third birthdays.  Call it nostalgia, or whatever.  Unfortunately, we had a very difficult time finding this particular model.  We were adamant about finding a metal one, you know, the one from the Dick and Jane readers of our youth.  We were able to find one at Walmart, but it had to be ordered and wouldn't arrive until the following Friday.  We would need to pick it up at the store and then assemble it.  When telling a friend about this, she suggested ordering it from Amazon, which should be re-named, Amazin', because we were able to get the exact same model at the same price, and have it shipped directly to the birthday boy's house! Plus, no delivery charge, no tax and it arrived in two days,instead of 5! From now on, Amazon will be the first place I look.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Wagon arrived ahead of time and very well packaged in cardboard boxes with air bags for protection.  The wagon is actually in it's own box from the manufacturer.  Assembly was simple requiring only a regular screwdriver, crescent wrench, and pliers.  Taking your time, 30 minutes to assemble.  Wagon is heavy duty and a great buy for the price.  Recommend highly.</div>

Within a minute, our baby knocked down the mesh flap-door and a few minutes after that, she tipped the tent over from pressing up against the walls.I should have paid closer attention to the product description/photos and realized that Velcro would not keep my baby inside when trying to get her to nap. We need something with a zipper. I plan to ship this back next week and get something that can contain my baby, like the Kwik Cabana II.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">This tent is easy to construct and holds togethers very well for the price. But I quickly discovered it was designed for younger, less active children than my 15 month old. First, she put all her toys into it and started pushing it over with one of her push cars, that seemed innocent enough, but before long she was in it herself pushing the walls and rolling around the playroom as if she was inside a giant gerbil ball. Foreseeable misuse? She also enjoyed pulling the poles out, so that she could wave them around and poke at things. If she could, my toddler would give this product five stars and title her review, "Great Fun," but from a mommy's perspective, it was not safe. We had to take it down.</div>

We bought ours for a trip to the beach with our oldest daughter 4 years ago & we're back at the beach this week, using the same tent for our 10 month old. It's easy to assemble & folds back up easily into a surprisingly small storage bag.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I bought this tent to take to the beach for my 8 month old.  The bag it comes in is so small that I thought, at first, that the tent may be too small for my baby.  The tent is a great size for an 8 month old and even a little larger.  It's very durable and is great for the beach, except that, when your baby isn't in it, you need to put something in it to keep it from blowing away.  The assembly was very easy for my husband who has assemble tents before, but I found it a bit more difficult.  I would recommend that you face the solid purple tent side in the direction of the sun as the shear sides don't provide shade.  The first day we used it on the beach, I ended up draping our beach towels over the side to shield my napping baby from the sun.  Overall, I am VERY happy with my purchase of this tent.  I think it is value priced, and it fits back into its very small back with ease.</div>

It is light weight and easy to assemble.This item does not come with stakes for the tent.  We purched them seperately for just $3 on Amazon and they fit in the bag that comes with the tent for storage.Sometimes the sun would still come through the sides too much but we just out a beach towel to block it.  It was well ventilated so this was not an issue.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">We purchased this tent for a recent beach trip with our 2 year old. The assembly was super easy and it folds up small enough to fit in my beach tote. I would suggest planning to place something heavy in the bottom to avoid being blown by the wind when the child is not inside, but otherwise, it's perfect!</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I used this during Memorial weekend at the beach. Overall I like the product. It was a little challenging to put the tent up by myself, but I was able to do it with some frustration. When the baby wasn't in it, I had to put something in the tent so it wouldn't blow away. Keep in mind it wasn't that windy. I like the fact the tent was very light to throw into a bag. I will be bringing this when I go to Lake Tahoe since it doesn't take a lot of space in the luggage and it's not heavy at all, I do hate that there is no padding on the bottom of the tent. I had a blanket that I used before laying the baby down, I'll prob look for a soft mat or something so the baby is more comfortable. Can't beat the price though. Oh, I was able to be in the tent with my bsby. She also fell asleep in the tent. I would recommend the manufacturer to add some printed animals inside the tent or add little hooks so patents csn attach toys to keep bsby entertained!</div>

Food isn't required, though, and costumes can add to the sense of play. All that is needed is one host and seven guests to become character-murder suspects on a train from Paris on June 13, 1940. The trip has already been completely organized with a host as guide, secret clues, guest invitations, player manuals, a cassette tape with murder details--even name tags and a diagram of the murder scene. Now that's travel planning! (Not recommended for children under 16)Lynne Sampson--</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B00000IVSX')" id="toggleBtn-B00000IVSX">Show more</button>

    <div class="answerText">All rounds can be played while dining. That being said I always serve appetizers and play the first round. At the end of round one I serve dinner and we play round two while we eat. Then I serve dessert after round two or three depending on how people are feeling. So we eat through the whole game, eating as we play. We have done 6 of these and it always works great!</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I won't go into great detail on the game structure other than to say it is great for parties and requires 8 people to play. We traditionally have a "Murder" each New Years Eve. These games are not really meant to be educational but using the leetle grey cells to follow the clues is a mentally challenging activity. Reusing an episode is really not feasible since the mystery is solved at the end and it doesn't change at all with replaying. I have reused these episodes with new sets of friends and just sit back and watch.This adventure is situated on a train leaving Nazi occupied Paris. The characters are great and the mystery is actually one that can be solved. This is one of the few HTHAMs that gives you a fighting chance to solve the mystery.If you are looking for a great evening of mystery and fun with friends, this is the game (and the episode) for you.</div>

Everyone dressed up and tried to play their parts-- the only hard part was all the names (french) and we went through the rounds much faster than the game anticipated because several members were VERY good at asking questions and managed to get information out of people (that they were supposed to keep secret).

    <div class="reviewText">Our nuclear family reunion in Helen, Georgia featured the last train from Paris this year.  We were able to incorporate the children as servers and cooks, so everyone felt they were participating.  (8 adults, 5 children).  It was very fun and convuluted enough to be challenging but yet not impossible.  We all had a great time and would recommend it.</div>

      <p>When it's time to go outside for a bit of fresh air and exercise, the Push Around Buggy from Step2 i<span id="dots-B00000IZEM">...</span><span id="more-B00000IZEM" style="display:none">s ready to roll. Just slip baby in the generous molded seat, hook up the seat belt, grab the handle, and go! While you actually steer, baby can pretend to drive (and can even start the fun with a nifty ignition key). When there's an obstacle in the way or a friend passing by, baby can honk the horn. The buggy rolls smoothly and surely on four oversize poly wheels. A small trunk in the front can hold a few travel items. Both durable and fun, this sweet red and blue Push Around Buggy is a winner. The extra-long handle is removable and can be stored underneath the buggy.--N. Mered</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B00000IZEM')" id="toggleBtn-B00000IZEM">Show more</button>

    <div class="reviewText">Our 14 month old loves it, he kept stealing other people's at the park so we had to buy it. It so great for a quick walk to the park or mailbox and not having to deal with the fuss of a stroller. However, the wheels are plastic and it is a bumpy ride, which our son loves, but this would not be something we would use to walk longer then a half a mile.</div>

It maneuvers very easily and seems to take any surface you push it on.  Not sure how long our Granddaughter will be able to ride in it as there is not a lot of leg room, but we are thoroughly enjoying it for now.</div>

He loved looking around and going on walks.  It's also a kid magnet at the park.  He's now 2 1/2 and is too big for it but in all fairness he's kinda tall for his age.  I would 100% recommend this to any parent.  We liked it so much that it's been our go to gift for first bday parties :)</div>

    <div class="answerText">It can be played as a percussion instrument with just about anything. Our 5 year old granddaughter prefers to play the drums so she uses her drum sticks to play it. She also uses wire wisks (the kind you use in a kitchen mixer) and anything else she can find - ink pens, spoons, etc....   She loves it and no matter what she uses the music is pleasant.</div>

She was 4 at the time and while we tried patiently to teach her to strum it with the pick she would take it from us knowingly and show us that it is properly played with a set of drumsticks!! One of the strings finally broke last night and she is heartbroken. I am shopping for new strings today.</div>

    <div class="answerText">A five year old could "use" it but it would depend on the child as to whether they could Play it or not.  I would say 7-9 is probably a good age to introduce a child to this if they had no musical background.  Saying that, it is an instrument you could purchase/acquire and play with around them and they may be able to pick it up at a much earlier age.  Well built, but not a "toy".</div>

Any string e x instrument will quickly go out of tun e u until it is broken in.  One of the sheets describes which strings should be turned to which note.  You need any reasonable means to tune it, be it an electronic tuner, a keyboard, or reference tones off the internet.  This is one of those things you have to learn to do for any string instrument.  By the way, when tuning the peg will sometimes get to a position where it will seem that you can't properly get the tool on it.  The tool has the same opening on the other end, only rotated, so you sound use the opposite end of the tool if you when you run into this situation...probably buried in the instructions somewhere.  Happy harping... and look for their song book for addition music templates... No need to learn to read music, if you don't want to.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I received this harp many years ago as a gift for Christmas.  I loved it then, and had many happy hours learning how to play the different songs that are provided,It is very easy to learn for children and once you have the basics of "tune" a child naturally starts to play music by memory and adapt other songs to the melodious harp on their own. You can also buy extra songs of different categories (Christmas, Christian, Folk, etc.)The only caveat I see with this lap harp - is unfortunately a very problematic one.  The strings on the harp are looped, and so two notes share one string (see picture) -  Making it very difficult to keep the harp in tune for longEX: Tightening one side can change the other, and thereby changing both notes.  Only a few years into having it as a child, I lost the "tuning key" and was completely unable to tune it thereafter. [A wrench, pliers, etc strip the small studs]I found my harp again in pristine condition from whence it was packed all these years, and it is still horribly out of tune.  I will have to buy a tuning key from a music store - after a second try with pliers stripped the pegs yet again.  Different tuning keys for different harps - not one fits all, so I discovered.I recommend the harp if you can KEEP your tuning key, or are adept at keeping it in tune easily.  It is a wonderful learning tool, and fun musical instrument that is different than most.ADDENDUM: Years ago as a child when the tuning key was lost, and internet was not an option - I did not know that there are stores and websites that sell accessories such as extra tuning keys and even Master Key Pitch pipes. After realizing how many people have read this review - I found a website to answer questions about the Music Maker Harp, as well as provide the accessories you need if a piece is lost or it goes out of tune![...]Hope this helps!!</div>

We have it on a laminate floor, and it doesn't slide at all.  It vacuums well, and it's not too big to take and shake outside.  I recommend it if you're looking for an activity rug.</div>

I can't think that any little girl wouldn't just love to get one for a gift, & we have had so much fun having little tea parties with them - they are nicely made, colorful, & boxed nicely too.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I read all of these reviews pretty thoroughly, most of which tout durability, even with the casual play of toddlers. Well...day 2 here and our first cup has broken after about an 18&#34; drop. We don't like plastic, so we search long and hard for durable ceramic, glass and wood alternatives, selecting this one so that we could put them through the dishwasher over wood options. But hmm...only time will tell how long it lasts.</div>

    <div class="answerText">Yes, you need two to four players.  You cannot play by yourself.  It's like Solitaire only with more players.  My granddaughters play it with me - the youngest is seven, but I learned with my cousin and his wife who are my age (70's)  There is just enough awareness needed to make it interesting.  It was like eating peanuts, we kept playing more games.  I had taught my granddaughters how to play Solitaire when they saw me playing it and so it was an easy transition to Kings in the Corner.  Enjoy!  Beth A.</div>

Some plays are right under your nose, but easily missed.  Like eating peanuts, we like just one more game.  A great game for families.  Mom and Dad will like it, too.</div>

    <div class="answerText">4 of those card positions are for the kings and 4 are for the play cards.  If I understand the rules correctly only the dealer puts in the four starting cards then each person takes their turns playing the card positions.  Not all 6 players put cards in the card positions at the same tme.  It just around the table to each player who then makes the moves on the card positions.</div>

    <div class="answerText">Four slots are for the four kings whenever they are drawn.  The other four slots are for playing lower suit cards until the top card in the stack can be played on a king or other stack.  The cards are played high to low, black on red or red on black like Solitaire.   The challenge for me is not to miss an opportunity for a play.  You must consider the cards in your hand as well as the stacks in the play tray. I have missed chances right under my nose!  It's a simple game with just enough challenge so that it is not boring.</div>

    <div class="answerText">Kings In the Corner is almost Solitaire except that there is more than one player.  It is simple; I play it with my granddaughters, ages 7 to 14.  The trick is to be alert to opportunities for matching the cards.  It is definitely low stress for adults, great if you want something simple while you snack and enjoy conversation.  You play several rounds to get enough points to win.  Good luck!</div>

With a realistic <span id="dots-B00004U3E4">...</span><span id="more-B00004U3E4" style="display:none">rear trash container and a front  cab that opens and closes, this sturdy Roadmax Garbage Truck makes it  easy for little ones to take on the role of the local garbage  collector. Sporting bright primary colors and oversize components with  smooth edges to prevent cuts and bruises, the garbage truck is made of  durable plastic and measures approximately 16.5 inches long and 9.5  inches high. The truck comes with a separate trash bin that can be  attached to the hand-powered lift on the back of the truck and then  dumped into the trash container. Once it's full, the truck driver can  lift the container and unload its contents at the dump. Equipped with  treaded rubber tires, the truck's front cab can be opened and closed  and is big enough to hold up to two action figures (sold separately).  Other Roadmax vehicles are sold separately.--Chris Burns</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B00004U3E4')" id="toggleBtn-B00004U3E4">Show more</button>

    <div class="answerText">No it is not too babyish.  Kids that age are very hard on toys, and this Bruder Garbage Truck is very durable.  I bought it for my grandson when he was 2 yrs, he's now 4 yrs and plays with it as much as he did in the beginning.  His cousin has the larger "more realistic" garbage truck, firetruck, dumptruck etc. and they have to be put away when the 4 year old comes to play.  I would say at least 5 yrs before you go with the more realistic larger Bruder Trucks.</div>

The top has a small portal that can be opened and she put toy blocks in through the hole.  After that she dumps them out and starts again.  The cabin also opens to allow for figures to be placed in the drivers seat.  The funniest part is hearing her make "vroom" sounds when she pushes it around.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I did not contact the seller about this problem since the pool was unavailable so I would have just been refunded. I like it overall and would be ecstatic if the pool held air like it should. Maybe we can find the leak and fix it. We use it as a huge ball pit for my 3 year old. Still does it's job just without the top rung. You win some you lose some.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I purchased it to cool down my 2 dogs on hot summer day. They are each small and middle size. The pool size is perfect for them to swim around. I spent an hour to set it up with an air bed battery-powered pump(I think I can cut it half to 30 min next time). You will double the time without a pump. Anyway, it is a good quality product that works really well! We enjoy it so much!! :)</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I purchased this pool for a party.  Didn't want little children bored and hot, as there parents would not have beenable to enjoy.At one time there were four children, well 2 children and 2 teenagers.  They all had a blast.The rings are separate which is good, we went to a gas station to inflate it, as our pumpdidn't work the morning of the party! LOL.  That was our own, old pump.Worth every penny, it is now folded neatly in the laundry room ready for any other summer parties.</div>

The handle height allows them to vacuum and navigate it underneath furniture, etc. I can't give you the exact size as it is at my daughter's house, but my grandson got it for his 2nd birthday and he wasn't interested in any other gifts!</div>

    <div class="reviewText">My 2 yr. old grandson opened this vacuum cleaner first at his birthday party and he wasn't interested in anything else but &#34;cleaning&#34; the rug.  After a half hour his grandpa was able to distract him and put the cleaner away so that he could focus on his other gifts.  (the microwave was also a big hit!)  He didn't understand how to get the cleaner out of the locked upright position so he needed help with that, but he loves his new vacuum!!</div>

You would be surprised how fast paint thinner disappears especially when using several different colors and brushes that are different sizes that use more paint and paint thinner to keep clean.</div>

Well needless to say I've been out of the loop for a while. When I recieved the figures to paint I was amazed at how small the figures were! Thank god I saw a review It was simpley titled " A Kids Review". In this review the kid suggested useing old dried up markers for painting smaller details.

    <div class="reviewText">Testor makes the absolute worst paint for modeling.  Enamel paint is HORRIBLE for any type of model.  It bleeds, it bubbles, it never coats properly.  Sure it might be good if your a kid and doing your little skill level 1 model projects but if you're a big boy, use big boy paints like Citadel.  Citadel is a damn good paint, not like this garbage!</div>

    <div class="answerText">Exterior is 48" x 38 ". The interior is about 44 x 37" and angled at the corners for the seats.  We've had ours for years and it's held up super well. It's in the sun about half the day and that might help how it's worn.  But kids and dogs have climbed on the lid (I try to keep them off) and no cracks yet.  The seats are more for me and although small, are tolerable for a while.  Was just out in ours yesterday with 2 grandkids. I like ours much better than the ones you usually see and it fits with our sandstone-type brick work we have here.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Gift for Grandbaby's third birthday.  She loves it.  I worried about the lid blowing off (we live by the bay and get some fierce winds sometimes) but so far it has stayed tight and has kept the sand dry.  It's a good size for one child, might be a bit crowded for more than one.  (Or maybe my little demolition crew is just more active than most.)  I also bought an assortment of shells and buried them in the sand - just like the beach.</div>

I suggest looking up the capacity - either by weight or volume of sand it holds to determine which is larger.

    <div class="reviewText">This is a perfect size sandbox for my 2 1/2-year-old granddaughter. It holds plenty of sand for building roads, molding objects, or just shoveling sand from one side to another. The press-on cover stays put and keeps the sand safe from animals and airborne debris. Only time will tell how durable it is, but it seems very sturdy. Yes, I would recommend to others.</div>

No water got in the sand but have to say during our biggest storm with high winds I did put a big flower pot filled with soil on lid. Everything stayed dry, animal free and lid did not crack. 2-3 children play together in it every weekend and love it.</div>

Our girls use the top as a boat when it is flipped over and have stood on top of it also which dents it in but it just pops right back out.  I was just digging in it today!</div>

The only thing I do not like is the edges of the top are a little sharp. The girls like to sit in the top and pretend it is a boat. They should round the edges over.  I like that the top is high enough to store the toys in it.</div>

    <div class="answerText">It's about 15.5 inches long, including the wagon, which does not detach. It's 5.5 inches wide and 7 inches tall.  The picture doesn't show, but there's an arch above the tractor, right behind the driver, that you can use like a handle to pick up the whole thing.  The wagon and the tractor articulate sideways, but when you pick it off the ground it stays level. This was a hit.  My son still loves it almost two years later.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">My 18mo loves this thing. He loves the animal noises and sings along with the farmer.  The tractor is very cute and looks well-made.  This picture doesn't show, but it has a &#34;handle&#34; over the middle part that can be used to pick the whole thing up and move it. The wagon part articulates but does not come apart. The wheels are rubberized and don't scratch my floors.I would give it five stars if it had an on/off switch or, even better, a volume button.  We put a piece of tape over the speaker holes, and that did the trick just fine - brought the volume down to a good level.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Great interactivity, great value, great options so that your little one won't get bored quickly. The only downside I can think off is that the trailer is not detachable, but then that is just my personal take! Well worth every penny (it's great when they are rocking to the tune :-))</div>

I was worried because the age given is young but he loves tractors, farms and farm animals so he likes it.  The only thing is that I let my grandson take the animals into the bathtub.  Not a good idea.  The sounds didn't work until they dried out.</div>

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">12 18, 2013</div>
    </div>
    <div class="reviewText">This Funtime Tractor is the "cat's meow" for any young child who loves and knows the song, "Old MacDonald Had a Farm".  Our grandson learned the song and now yells out E-I-E-I-O, asking for the videos on the I-phone or brings us his Old MacDonald books to read.  At 22 months, he can sing the whole song and picks which animal we sing about.  This toy was the best gift for him!  He loves every feature about it.  Push down the farmer, and the "Old MacDonald" sings an Old MacDonald verse, which is a catchy tune, well done.  Push down on each animal in the wagon and each animal sounds off, recordings of real animal sounds.  The farmer and animals can be removed for independent play and are well-made chunky sized for little hands.  Push the orange smoke stack and the tractor moves forward until you push it again for the brakes (which sound real!) or the tractor soon comes to a halt itself.  Push on the tractor horn and it has a realistic honk.Our 22 month old grandson loves this toy, hasn't tired of it, and it's holding up well, durable for use with lots of hands-on and drops by preschoolers.  The tractor and wagon are connected and don't fall apart.  I truly recommend this for any young child who loves Old MacDonald or farm animals.  I must say that the animals are sometimes difficult to pull up out of their positions tightly held in the wagon that make them sound off, but our grandson is learning to pull harder, or get help from us, saying "Cock-a-doodle do stuck! Help!"  This is an educational toy for imaginative play, recognizing the various animals and their sounds and the famous song.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">UPDATE..........I 'would NOT' buy this product. The toy is so good and my grandson loves it. The problem is that they 'BOTH' broke. It is an expensive toy to keep replacing. It is best to NOT BUY it in the first place. My grandson is only 15 mos. old so he is not hard on the tractor. This time, after a few days the wheels slowed down, the horn did not work and they the sounds on the card stopped working. The first tractor the whole thing stopped. YES I have replaced the batteries to make sure that it is not the problem.I am ordering this toy again because it broke. I 'have' to order again because it is my 14 mos. old grandsons favorite toy. I should contact the company because it is only about one month old. I thought it would last longer than that. At first I thought it was the batteries so I replaced them with new. It still didn't work. Disappointing......  Nothing plays and the wheels don't go around. WHEN IT WORKS.......it is a great toy. I am also ordering the John Deer tractor as a backup. ONE MORE THING.......be careful if you put it in the playpen. He stands on it and lifts himself up to the top. He almost gets over the top. SOOOOOOO.......that is my job to take it 'out' of the playpen :)</div>

At 22 months, he can sing the whole song and picks which animal we sing about.  This toy was the best gift for him!  He loves every feature about it.  Push down the farmer, and the "Old MacDonald" sings an Old MacDonald verse, which is a catchy tune, well done.  Push down on each animal in the wagon and each animal sounds off, recordings of real animal sounds.  The farmer and animals can be removed for independent play and are well-made chunky sized for little hands.  Push the orange smoke stack and the tractor moves forward until you push it again for the brakes (which sound real!) or the tractor soon comes to a halt itself.  Push on the tractor horn and it has a realistic honk.Our 22 month old grandson loves this toy, hasn't tired of it, and it's holding up well, durable for use with lots of hands-on and drops by preschoolers.  The tractor and wagon are connected and don't fall apart.  I truly recommend this for any young child who loves Old MacDonald or farm animals.  I must say that the animals are sometimes difficult to pull up out of their positions tightly held in the wagon that make them sound off, but our grandson is learning to pull harder, or get help from us, saying "Cock-a-doodle do stuck! Help!"  This is an educational toy for imaginative play, recognizing the various animals and their sounds and the famous song.</div>

I had to open it and try it when I got it.  the lights work, the horn works, the animals make noises when you put them in their place on the cart.  The wheels are friction activated.  It's just so much fun packed into this toy, I would recommend it to everyone.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">My daughter received this for her 1st birthday and still plays with it at age 3. There are lots of different ways to play with it. Sometimes she takes the animals out to play with them, sometimes she sings with the tractor, and sometimes she walks along beside it. I can't stand super loud toys but this one is nice because the song and the animal noises are not too loud. I can't say enough good things about this toy!</div>

(And, if you know 3- to 6-year-olds that won't lose all the included cards and balls, they may also learn sharing, cooperation, and imaginative play.) The bottom of the box houses the game itself, with three chutes along the top that the balls are dropped into and three rows of flip-up panels that are decorated with various colored objects. Players draw cards, match them to a panel, flip up the panel, and hope there is a ball underneath it. Once all six balls are recovered a treasure chest pops open and gameplay can begin anew.--Pam Lauer</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B000063XO3')" id="toggleBtn-B000063XO3">Show more</button>

As they get bigger, its more complex matching.  It's easy, quick, doesn't take a lot of skill or strategy.  Lots of fun and not painful for parents to play either!</div>

We have used it to help learn about colors and shapes. the only thing this train is missing is a way for the toddler to tug it. (they love tugging) so I secured a shoelace to the bottom of the engine piece and the other end of the shoe string to a large wooden bead my wife had lying around the house. Now our son really likes this toy as he enjoys tugging it behind him from room to room.High quality wood, paint and finish. Melissa and Doug have done it again!</div>

    <div class="answerText">No, I don't think it will. I haven't tried it personally, but the Thomas trains (which we have) are supposed to work with the M&D; tracks, and this train is much wider than the Thomas or other similar trains. Each block is about 1.75-2 inches wide, making the wheels at least 2 in apart, too big for those tracks.</div>

I've never had them tear or break.  He's been pretty rough on them and they've held up really well over the last 2 years.  I definitely recommend.</div>

    <div class="answerText">My grandson was 22 months old.  We used the squares and cutouts on the plane but not the pegs.  We used the pegs in the hotel room though.  Just remember that things that come apart can be dropped and 'lost' under the seat, especially if they like to throw things!  Not sure if it was worth the money.  The best toy we found was Bucky.  It is a turtle that has buckles all over it. That kept him very entertained.  We were way overpacked with toys.  Our grandson loved looking out the window and we planned it so he played like crazy at the airport and fell asleep after taking off.</div>

    <div class="answerText">That probably depends on your child.  I got them for my son at 12 months and at that point he mostly had fun popping the shapes out of their mold (basically, the cat you see in the picture pops out of the red surround to essentially make a 2 pc puzzle).  I had to put it back in for him but it kept him entertained.  I don't remember if he used the pegs or not right away. Again, that might depend on your child.  Good luck!</div>

    <div class="answerText">Hi,My daughter received it at 18 months, and each child is different.  If she has interest in putting things together (pegs and puzzle pieces) and can manipulate her hands to take the items apart, I would recommend it.  It has the little pegs that stick together and can fit into little holes on shapes.  It does have bright colors and shapes to talk about.  I am unsure of how long the 15 mo old would play with it, so I would have a back up for a long flight.Have a blessed day!</div>

    <div class="answerText">Yes. My only objection to the laces (there are two) is that they (1) do not have anything on the end to stop the progress of the bead and (2) have aglets (the stiff end of the lace) that are too small and too short.  Young or disabled hands have trouble dealing with those two issues.</div>

There are very few educational toys that she can enjoy and when we found that she loved the Alex Toys "String a Farm" and "String a Treat" toys so much that she nearly wore them out, we opted to try this one.Big mistake. (1) There is nothing on one end of the lace to stop the bead from just sliding right on off. The Alex Toys versions have a built in, secured "end" to stop the beads when they are strung. (2) The "aglets" (the end of the string that you poke through the bead) on this toy are too small and too short for clumsy fingers to get all the way through the bead easily. The aglets on the Alex Toys versions are thick and long enough to make it easy to thread them through the beads. (They feature the aglets prominently in their packaging, for just that reason.) (3) The inside of the beads are unfinished, causing the thread to catch and frustrate the person using them to no end (if they weren't frustrated enough!I normally love Melissa and Doug products, but I can't recommend this one, at least not for individuals who struggle with this kind of dexterity anyway.

    <div class="reviewText">This is a great set and helps improve fine motor skills. I do have a few complaints, however. First, the inside of the beads is not sanded which can make it difficult for the little ones to get the string thoroughly the block.  To compensate for this they made the whole in the blocks bigger, which brings me to problem number two.  The holes are to big in the blocks.  Even if you tie a knot in the end of the string the locks still slide off the end. Problem number three is the case. It works alright, but it doesn't hold the blocks in very well when you want to put them up.</div>

    <div class="answerText">Very easily blown up by hand. No pump necessary -- in fact, I think it would be over-kill and probably quickly pop it, LOL. My daughter loved this float last summer and will probably be bitterly disappointed that she's too big for it now.</div>

    <div class="answerText">One other comment: I saw the post from the person who said they killed themselves blowing it up. Floats these days have a valve that you have to pinch when you're blowing them up. If you're not doing it right, yes, you're going to bust a gut trying to blow it up. If you're pinching it right, it should only take a few  minutes at most.</div>

My 6-month old baby girl gets water in her mouth all the time. not very functional for smaller babies. Recommend for older babies.</div>

The delivery also went very quick so that I as the person gifting can only say the experience was positive. As for the recipient, I guess she is happy too and is getting good mileage out of her tractor. Too bad it is not available in other colours like say pink, which seems to be big among little girls of a certain age... I understand there are no problems with the wheels and perhaps for very small kids, the wagon on the back may af first be a bit much for the tyke in terms of steering but I think by the age of three, she will have mastered having the piece on the back of the tractor!</div>

    </div>
    <div class="reviewText">I am disappointed in this tractor. The plastic wheels slip on everything, and overall this toy is extremely cheap and flimsy. There is a measly 11-lb weight limit on the trailer, though I would not trust more than 5 lbs. The trailer is is constantly coming apart from the base - it doesn't attach securely to the pegs and so is merely held on by gravity. How lame is that? Do I really need to patch a Peg Perego toy together with Super Glue? I feel cheated. True, this toy is not as expensive as some Peg Perego products, but I would prefer they make a quality product and charge me more than sell this weak product under their brand name known for quality. Not anymore, I guess.On the flip side, it does look cute, and my son likes it, even though it frustrates him by constantly falling apart and having the wheels slip on nearly every surface. I had to take sandpaper and cut grooves with Xacto blades to the wheels for added grip. Which actually now work fairly well. If you have a spare 2-3 hours to do this, and what busy mom of three doesn't, by all means try it.</div>

Too bad it is not available in other colours like say pink, which seems to be big among little girls of a certain age... I understand there are no problems with the wheels and perhaps for very small kids, the wagon on the back may af first be a bit much for the tyke in terms of steering but I think by the age of three, she will have mastered having the piece on the back of the tractor!</div>

    <div class="reviewText">We started buying Bruder toys for my son when he was 2 or younger. He has so many Bruder toys and loves all of them and plays with them everyday. They are well made and hold up great. After getting this toy and the log splitter for my son's birthday, that's all he wanted to play with. We decided that he will get a Bruder toy for every special occasion. :-)</div>

It looks nice in the pictures and in person.  It is very cheaply made and the plastic is thin and not designed for kid type playing.  The tracks came off on the first day. and the top separated from the base within the week. It ended up in the trash less than 10 days after we got it.  Waste of money if you intend on letting a child actually play with it.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I bought this for my son as a gift a while ago thinking he would actually be able to play with it in the sand or dirt.  The only good thing I can say about this product is that it looks nice out of the box, but looks can be deceiving so don&#8217;t&#8217; be fooled by the pictures or appearance of this toy excavator.Everything is made of thin cheap plastic that breaks very easily.  Within a day one of the tracks came off and broke.  At first I was able to snap it back together, but after two days the plastic broke completely.  Then the base of the tracks and the top of the excavator separated and could not be fixed.  My son ended up just playing with the top part of the toy and then the bucket teeth broke and the plastic hydraulic bars broke off.  IT LASTED LESS THAN A WEEK AND WENT INTO THE TRASH!!!  JUNK!!!  This &#8220;toy&#8221; is not meant to be played with by any child.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">This toy is very cool looking and, from its appearance, should provide lots of fun for kids. However, it is very flimsy and, considering the number of moving parts, will probably not hold up for very long.  Additionally, there are no instructions about how to make any of the moving parts work, which means that kids will force them and break them through no fault of their own. It wouldn't cost much to add a few lines about how to make the arm go up and down or move the other parts.Pretty disappointing, in general, considering the price.</div>

    <div class="answerText">The main section of this excavator is about 11 inches long and 7.5 inches wide.  With the boom of the shovel fully extended the entire unit is almost 2 feet long.  The toy is 1/16th scale.  It's larger than you might think.  Just look at the handle on top of the boom.  You can fit an adult size hand in that handle alone.  It's an impressive toy.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I bought this excavator for my 5 year old boy and he loves it.  Its much larger than I expected and very high quality.  The shovel does swing 360 degrees and the bucket moves and extends in a realistic fashion.  The tracks move easily and it rolls smoothly even on carpet.  The cab door does not open, and to put a guy in the seat, you have to shove him through the window space.  This frustrates my 5 year old somewhat.  The engine compartment does open. This is a very nice toy and if you are planning on letting your child use it in the sand, there are lots of little places that sand will get into and probably never come out.  My boy has no trouble working the digger but we use it to scoop blocks and marbles not dirt.  It's just too nice to mess up.  One major positive is that there is no real small pieces to lose or break.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">My grandson wanted this for his 3rd birthday.  It looks really cute, but it is all plastic.  It does not look very sturdy at all.  I wished it was made of metal, but then metal rust.  I chose 3 stars because it looks great, but I doubt it will last very long before parts start breaking.  I expected better for the price.  I'm sure my grandson will love it.</div>

Although the materials may sound cheap, it does have a realistic appearance of being bronze or metallic like. It shows well with a richly stained stand that really gives it a rich appearance.

    <div class="reviewText">I bought this globe for my dad for Christmas. Good globes that are reasonably priced are actually pretty hard to find. I searched various other sites including the National Geographic store, but either the globes had poor reviews, or were extremely expensive. This globe is the perfect price and had good reviews, so I purchased it, and I am happy I did.The Good:-Delivery was fast and efficient. Someone said the globe comes in a giant box the size of a large oven. That wasn't the case for me. Maybe a microwave oven sized box, if that. The one drawback I had with delivery is that I marked this item as a gift on amazon, yet it still came with large 'GLOBE' markings on the box. Amazon refunded me $20 for this inconvenience.-Very easy to put together. All holes are pre-drilled and everything screws in easily. I think all I needed was a phillips head screwdriver. The whole process from opening the box to full assembly took about 15 minutes-Size. The globe and stand are a nice size. The stand is a little over 3' tall. The unit fits nicely in a small or medium size office and isn't too bulkyThe Bad:-The globe itself is a little cheap. The equator has a gold band around it that is basically a laminate sticker that looks like it can easily peel off. And the globe itself is very light and the build quality in general isn't the best. I only took off one star for this though, because it is still a decent globe, and the way it sits flush in the stand and smoothly rotates is very nice.Overall I recommend this globe for a gift or for yourself. It is a nice decorative item and can be educational too. My dad says he takes little breaks from his work to look at the globe and relax. It should be mentioned that the print is somewhat small. He mentions he uses a magnifying glass to look at cities, but I can't fault the globe for this because almost all have small print, and he has bad eyes.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I purchased this as a gift for someone but I had to assemble it first.  After reading other reviews of misaligned holes making assembly difficult, I decided I would do the hard work before giving it as a gift.  This item was packaged nicely in one box.  Everything was individually wrapped and damage free.  A lot of work went into shipping this globe so that it would not be damaged, I was honestly expecting to receive a squashed globe that looked more like an earthly helmet but it was packaged absolutely wonderful which is important to me.  Assembly was easy and only took about 15 minutes.  There was no discrepancy with holes lining up, it was simply easy to put together.  The finished product is both functional and acts like a piece of fine furniture so I kept it for myself and used a gift card for the person it was suppose to go to.  In any event, I love this globe, the meridians and equator line up exactly as their suppose to, the color is very distinct and rich looking, the ridges representing mountain ranges are a nice feature and make the globe a workable and functioning product.  I can't say anything bad about this globe and believe me, I scrutinize everything.  If you're in need of a classy globe at an affordable price, you won't be disappointed with this one.</div>

    <div class="answerText">It depends on a couple of things, like how much painting you want to do and how comfortable you are with painting and gluing small parts and details.

    <div class="reviewText">I built one of the Revell USS Missouri models when I was a teenager, around 1957-59, and loved it.  After watching the USS Iowa depart San Francisco on May 26 with my 11-year old grandson, it was time to do it again.  We're almost done, and it we had a great time.  I was somewhat disappointed in some aspects of the accuracy.  For example, there is a single rudder, not two (the Iowa class battleships had two), and there are no propellers or shafts.  The bottom is flat, and there is no below the waterline bulge at the bow.  The paint scheme is also weird:  below the waterline is red, and there is no black stripe separating the red from the gray freeboard.  This is unlike every single picture I've seen of any of the Iowa-class battleships and unlike the picture of the completed model on the box.  The barrels of all the guns are to be painted silver, also unlike the real thing.  The quality of the model?  Having assembled numerous Revell and Monogram models, I knew what to expect and was not disappointed.  There seemed to be more flash than I remembered, but that was 50 years ago, and easy to trim.  All in all, I recommend it if you want an inexpensive model of a great ship.  Besides, it's just about the only show in town in that price range.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I received this kit as a gift for my birthday.  At the time I had only built two other ships - the Arizona and Lionfish.  When I was building the Arizona I had difficulty painting the deck tan which was my big fear about this kit.  It didn't turn out to be as big a problem on this one.  One of the nicest features of this kit is the one piece hull.  The Missouri has around 70 parts so its a medium size kit.  The deck was also one piece that just fit snugly over the hull.  Overall, the kit is pretty well designed and easy to construct.  The big issue for me was the painting.  For the deck I just painted it tan and then with a smaller brush went over all the details in gray.  The only problem with that is the gray doesn't match the gray of the polystyrene so you should probably paint everything gray first.  Also the decal on the stern looks kind of goofy.  I've never been on the Missouri or seen pictures of the stern so I don't know if the decal is accurate.  It looks too big and lopsided, but like I said I don't know.  Overall, it was a fairly good kit for the price, but it's not super detailed or museum quality so if you're looking for something along those lines don't get this model.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I bought this or received it as a Christmas present back in the early days, late 50's and I spent a lot of time building this model. I already had model building experience so I knew what was going to take place. If I didn't have the tools, glue and paint it would never been finished! Cleaning all the excess plasic and junk was first, then parts that had to move were checked so they would move! A lot of detail went in the process before things were put together! I watched the tv series Victory at Sea and got a lot of clues what needed to be painted! Basically painting is a option, Battleship gray was the primary colors on most everything except the main deck! Painting the 16" guns, ack ack guns, 40mm guns, the 2 planes was and still is personal preference! Testors was the best paint to use and as far as the glue, a good styrene glue worked the best! Check the pictures that you can find on Google and you will know for sure what was painted anything except battleship gray! I had a total of 45 models, USS Mo, 1st Atomic Sub nautilus, 4 tanks, 1 190 mm cannon on 2 heavy trucks for light Atomic weapons that the military never used, but spent billions to build them and the rest was jets of all kinds, DC-3, DC-8, B-36 bomber, B-17, B-24, B-29 and the USS Enterprise from Star Trek! If you don't have the patience, the will, the right tools, GIVE IT UP!</div>

Although, you could make some modifications and have the motor to have a r/c Battleship. But I highly doubt that because this plastic model is too light.

    <div class="reviewText">I bought the Revell USS Missouri a little over than two months ago, and I just finished building it, which took me like six days. Basically, all the parts are very small, so you have to be very careful not to break the delicate plastics. The ship model length is approximately twenty inches long, and the detail of the kit is extremely basic; thus if you want further details I would recommend to buy the 1/350 scale from other manufacturers such as Taniya. I hope in the future Revell will develop a bigger  model kit of this historical battleship as the Trumpeter has recently released a 1/200 USS Missouri. When I have the budget, I'll definitely purchase the 1/200 one.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I received this kit as a gift for my birthday.  At the time I had only built two other ships - the Arizona and Lionfish.  When I was building the Arizona I had difficulty painting the deck tan which was my big fear about this kit.  It didn't turn out to be as big a problem on this one.  One of the nicest features of this kit is the one piece hull.  The Missouri has around 70 parts so its a medium size kit.  The deck was also one piece that just fit snugly over the hull.  Overall, the kit is pretty well designed and easy to construct.  The big issue for me was the painting.  For the deck I just painted it tan and then with a smaller brush went over all the details in gray.  The only problem with that is the gray doesn't match the gray of the polystyrene so you should probably paint everything gray first.  Also the decal on the stern looks kind of goofy.  I've never been on the Missouri or seen pictures of the stern so I don't know if the decal is accurate.  It looks too big and lopsided, but like I said I don't know.  Overall, it was a fairly good kit for the price, but it's not super detailed or museum quality so if you're looking for something along those lines don't get this model.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">In 1953 and '54 I was privileged to command three American warships simultaneously. These were the aircraft carrier USS Franklin D. Roosevelt, the destroyer USS Sullivan and the battleship USS Missouri. I do believe I was the youngest naval officer at the time, being only 10 years of age.I took on the Japanese fleet in my bedroom. I accepted their surrender in 1955 aboard the USS Missouri which was stationed on my windowsill. Turning to the world's press I then announced to all: "These proceedings are now closed."I remember these Revell models so very well. It's been fifty years now, but I still remember deciding not to glue down the guns, allowing them to swivel.Assembly instructions ranged from easy to impossible. I remember using the picture on the box as an aid. When instructions were easy I enjoyed the work. When instructions got hairy I became upset. Time to yell, "Ma!" though I knew I shouldn't. I was supposed to do it myself."Slow down," she would tell me. "Do it right. Don't be in such a hurry to finish."I'm glad for the experience of building these models although I'm not exactly sure why it remains in my head. Treasured memories? Perhaps. Maybe something more: Often do I think about the guys who fought and died so that I could be a 10-year old engaging in my fantasies.Thank you, gentlemen. You are NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN!</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I built one of the Revell USS Missouri models when I was a teenager, around 1957-59, and loved it.  After watching the USS Iowa depart San Francisco on May 26 with my 11-year old grandson, it was time to do it again.  We're almost done, and it we had a great time.  I was somewhat disappointed in some aspects of the accuracy.  For example, there is a single rudder, not two (the Iowa class battleships had two), and there are no propellers or shafts.  The bottom is flat, and there is no below the waterline bulge at the bow.  The paint scheme is also weird:  below the waterline is red, and there is no black stripe separating the red from the gray freeboard.  This is unlike every single picture I've seen of any of the Iowa-class battleships and unlike the picture of the completed model on the box.  The barrels of all the guns are to be painted silver, also unlike the real thing.  The quality of the model?  Having assembled numerous Revell and Monogram models, I knew what to expect and was not disappointed.  There seemed to be more flash than I remembered, but that was 50 years ago, and easy to trim.  All in all, I recommend it if you want an inexpensive model of a great ship.  Besides, it's just about the only show in town in that price range.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I received this kit as a gift for my birthday.  At the time I had only built two other ships - the Arizona and Lionfish.  When I was building the Arizona I had difficulty painting the deck tan which was my big fear about this kit.  It didn't turn out to be as big a problem on this one.  One of the nicest features of this kit is the one piece hull.  The Missouri has around 70 parts so its a medium size kit.  The deck was also one piece that just fit snugly over the hull.  Overall, the kit is pretty well designed and easy to construct.  The big issue for me was the painting.  For the deck I just painted it tan and then with a smaller brush went over all the details in gray.  The only problem with that is the gray doesn't match the gray of the polystyrene so you should probably paint everything gray first.  Also the decal on the stern looks kind of goofy.  I've never been on the Missouri or seen pictures of the stern so I don't know if the decal is accurate.  It looks too big and lopsided, but like I said I don't know.  Overall, it was a fairly good kit for the price, but it's not super detailed or museum quality so if you're looking for something along those lines don't get this model.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I don't normaly build battelship as I love building tallships sailing ships of the line. They seem to be more detaled, but I got this mainly because of the price and It is just what you pay for. Very poor model and very little detail. Could not recomand this model to anyone over ten years. It is a shame this ship desirves to have a better model than this one, but you get what you pay for. Best services did a great job getting the model to me and they can't be held responsible for the model. So I killed a few days doing this that is about all I can say for it. Get a larger scale and spend a little more don't wast your money on this one.</div>

I already had model building experience so I knew what was going to take place. If I didn't have the tools, glue and paint it would never been finished! Cleaning all the excess plasic and junk was first, then parts that had to move were checked so they would move! A lot of detail went in the process before things were put together! I watched the tv series Victory at Sea and got a lot of clues what needed to be painted! Basically painting is a option, Battleship gray was the primary colors on most everything except the main deck! Painting the 16" guns, ack ack guns, 40mm guns, the 2 planes was and still is personal preference! Testors was the best paint to use and as far as the glue, a good styrene glue worked the best! Check the pictures that you can find on Google and you will know for sure what was painted anything except battleship gray! I had a total of 45 models, USS Mo, 1st Atomic Sub nautilus, 4 tanks, 1 190 mm cannon on 2 heavy trucks for light Atomic weapons that the military never used, but spent billions to build them and the rest was jets of all kinds, DC-3, DC-8, B-36 bomber, B-17, B-24, B-29 and the USS Enterprise from Star Trek!

    <div class="answerText">There isn't any rigging with the kit. You will have to make your own rigging out of a thick thread and I don't remember if there is a diagram showing where its supposed to go! Might be something on the box! You might Google USS Missouri and maybe you can get information of the rigging in the pictures. Thread is a dust catcher and my recommendation is not to put any thread on the model, but personal preference is your choice!</div>

It's a cool detail to find out.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Have to say I bought this model and wanted to take the time to build it as best as I could, then I found all the paint I needed.  Well here is my review:  The model is really detailed, be careful as there are really tiny stuff in the cockpit to be assembled and painted and also decals to work on it very tiny, but the result is so realistic, for instance you need to build the bomb release control on the bombers position.  You also get twelve bombs, Little Boy and Fat Man are also included but for some I guess politically correct issue they don't sell this model as the Enola Gay (the one I wanted) but you get The Cream of the Crop, anyway, besides that other details comes from the crew's bedrooms, radio desk, and gunmen positions, it is awesome.  It took me 10 days in a row to work it out, as painting process takes time and you need to go section by section.I used automotive spray aluminum paint to achieve a better finish on the fuselage and it really worked, no brush marks and even a more realistic look.  I'll be uploading some pictures of the model once I get the Enola Gay's decals.  It's a must have for collectors.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I liked this kit. It has its flaws but will turn out to be a awesome model and one of your favorites. You can build two variants which is enough for me, Cream of the Crop and Humpin Honey. Don't worry there is no nudity in the decals if it will offend anyone. The interior detail is fine. The directions suggest little detail so you must come up with it on your own. The exterior detail is average for a large model. However this kit is so amazing because of its nice appeal and and smoothness. It is a giant! 25&#34; by 35&#34;! making it one of the biggest models I have ever built. I must hang it from my ceiling because I have no were else to put it! It is not very difficult actually it is fairly easy to build and paint. I was able to finish it in 3 weeks of non stop work. Comes with alot of custom pieces such as Atom bombs and crew. Overall I would rate it at a 4.5, but I will rate it at a 5 for Awesome looks.</div>

    <div class="answerText">I don't recommend that. Because the model is very beautiful and detailed, and you need to get the feel about how to organize the pieces, what to paint first, how to handle the crystal clear parts, when to paint and glue, and how to get the finishing an final assembly of the whole set. You can try first with a smaller model, with detailed painting, decals and clear parts, so you can acquire those skills and then go for the B52. Takes a lot of patience and well on my first model I glued the pieces before paint them and it was a huge mistake, just an example on my own experience. Good luck friend!

    <div class="answerText">Yes, I think you could start with the B29 Superfortress because it's a larger model than most, which makes it easier to deal with. Be patient while working on your first model...it takes manual dexterity and diligence to complete a model such as the B29 Superfortress. Then you can work on the B-17 next, which is smaller.  Hope this helps.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">My husband and grandson had a great time putting this model together.  Patience is required working on models....no model is perfect, so don't give up. I read reviews that come from perfectionists that need every model to be just perfect for them to get any enjoyment out of it. Well, that's unreal....the idea is to enjoy working on a model. It's better to put it down when it gets frustrating and resume work later on. Overall this was a good-value product.  Now we're looking for the next model to order from Amazon. We've ordered mostly &#34;Revell&#34;, but there are other models out there.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Have to say I bought this model and wanted to take the time to build it as best as I could, then I found all the paint I needed.  Well here is my review:  The model is really detailed, be careful as there are really tiny stuff in the cockpit to be assembled and painted and also decals to work on it very tiny, but the result is so realistic, for instance you need to build the bomb release control on the bombers position.  You also get twelve bombs, Little Boy and Fat Man are also included but for some I guess politically correct issue they don't sell this model as the Enola Gay (the one I wanted) but you get The Cream of the Crop, anyway, besides that other details comes from the crew's bedrooms, radio desk, and gunmen positions, it is awesome.  It took me 10 days in a row to work it out, as painting process takes time and you need to go section by section.I used automotive spray aluminum paint to achieve a better finish on the fuselage and it really worked, no brush marks and even a more realistic look.  I'll be uploading some pictures of the model once I get the Enola Gay's decals.  It's a must have for collectors.</div>

Also be sure to line up the cup holder and the space provided for it, other wise it will be a pain to do it after you have inflated the arm rest section of the chair.  despite all of this I find the lounge to be comfortable, but be warn it is not design to take a nap in.</div>

Sorry I cannot be of assistance.  Siince they don't cost that much and the joy the kids get, perhaps it would be best to just replace the rockets.  Sorry.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">This was a gift for 7 yearold boy.  It was the first gift opened and teh kids played with it for about an hour before doing anything else!  They had a grat time and it is good for 'wearing them out' too!  The only downfall is having to stay off roofs and things, but this would be ideal for use in a park or camping or other oen area.  The kids playing ranged from 2 to 10 (adults liked it as well haha)!  Would recommend for any boy... and a great way to get out from in front of the video machine!</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Got this to go with the Melissa and Doug Deluxe Doll House for my 3 year old grandson.  We wound up having to paint the house a different color since it was pink and purple and his mother didn't want him playing with pink houses.....but a little paint and it was an almond house with brown accents.  These people are perfect and he loves it</div>

      <p>Super T MEDIUM gap-filling CA glue has a viscosity (200-300 cps), similar to syrup and is perfect fo<span id="dots-B0006O3TO4">...</span><span id="more-B0006O3TO4" style="display:none">r gluing somewhat porous materials and pieces which have small gaps between them. Super T instant glue cures at a slower speed (10-25 seconds) than Hot Stuff. You can bond wood, metal, rubber, nitrile, composites like carbon fiber and Kevlar, many types of plastics, and more. To bond two parts together, apply the Super T CA glue to one part and accelerator to the other part, then push together and hold tightly for 30 seconds.

Super T is Satellite City's most versatile CA glue, able to bond porous and non-porous materials with a good fit as well as fill gaps, which is why it is so popular. You don't have to be a professional to use Super T- it's perfect not only for recreational hobbies like model-building, but also for fixing all the little things that fall apart.

In addition to bonding parts together, you can easily use Super T for a professional-quality finish and to repair damage to other finishes. 

We recommend using NCF Quick CA glue accelerator to speed up the cure time and ensure a complete cure of the bond. Accelerator is not always necessary when bonding materials, but it is a must-have when using Super T as a finish because it can take hours instead of seconds for CA glue to cure when it is sitting on a surface instead of being pressed between two parts.

This item is a 1oz bottle of Super T.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B0006O3TO4')" id="toggleBtn-B0006O3TO4">Show more</button>

This is the best super glue I have found and I have tried a lot of them. I find the "Gap Filling" Hot Stuff to be more versatile than the thinner "Original" type.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">This product is really good super-glue.  It response well to &#34;kicker&#34; (the spray that near instantly dries it).The bottle is not made very well.  The nozzle will slowly be snapped away because the glue dries inside the nozzle even with the cap securely on.  By simply pricking the hole back open with a pin or nail is really not an option because this stuff dries really solid.  I hammered a nail into it one time but eventually I can see the nozzle disappearing completely.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I have never seen my grandchildren (ages 7 and almost 4) have so much fun with a toy!  I thought they'd have to wait for warmer weather to play with it, but with the soft rockets, the Stomp Rocket can be used inside, especially in a long rec room.  The two actually played together, with one aiming the rocket attached to the hose and the other jumping on the air &#34;bladder.&#34;  (No batteries!)  They haven't tried the rocket yet using the stand outside.  I warned my daughter to be sure they keep it away from the house and trees or they'll lose a lot of rockets.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">This is a great toy if you have the space.  I was a little sceptical about it's claim of flying 200+ feet in the air, but it does.  The rockets need to be launched a few times before they really start to fly high-  I can't explain why, but it seems to be the case.  The rockets themselves are durable enough for the price, but the fins begin to get worn and torn over time.  I've repaired mine a few times with scotch tape.  They do sell replacement rockets but I haven't needed to go that route yet.  The air bladder that you stomp on is very durable- even when adults stomp it.  Smaller, lighter children will have a harder time launching the rockets because they simply don't have the mass to stomp down with much force. My 6 year old loves it.  When we bring this to the park, all the other kids gravitate over and want to get in on the fun.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">The piano looks nice, and is made reasonably well. The tone, however, is not at all musical. It sounds more like hitting a pan than like a musical instrument. We have many instruments for our son, and all of the others sound reasonably musical. The lowest note is out of tune quite a bit and some of the others are slightly out also. Chords sound terrible in any position. While a melody is recognizable when played, chords are not. We are quite dissapointed, and will only be buying musical instruments from brick and mortar locations so that we can try them out first. My son prefers other instruments to this one, even if they are out of tune, because the tone is unpleasant, and often downright irritating. I recommend an electric keyboard over this one so that you can get nice musical tones.</div>

It's the perfect size for little ones. The sound is a little odd at first (i was expecting more of a real piano vs the chimey odd sound) but you get used to it and don't even notice after a bit. Assembly is super easy, 10 minutes maybe. I would buy it again and highly recommend!</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Purchased this foot pump to inflate a queen size mattress that we bring camping with us.  It worked fine.  The hose is long enough to be attached to the mattress inside the tent while I stood outside the tent stepping on the bellows.It did not take an extraordinary amount of time to inflate the mattress.  Did not have any problems with the nozzle coming out. When the mattress got near &#34;extra firm&#34; fullness, I did notice that I had to make sure I didn't miss a beat with stepping on the bellows or the air did seem to leak out a bit but that wasn't an issue for me.  Please note that this is a large piece of equipment as indicated in the product specs but I knew this when I bought it and bought it because of its ability to push air into the mattress quicker than the smaller foot pump we already had.  I did not use the deflating option so can't comment on that.  Overall this meets my expectations.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I bought this pump to replace the various hand pumps provided with stability balls.  The hand pumps work and will definitely fill the ball until it is rigid, but you feel like you already completed a workout by the time you are done.So, I saw this foot pump and read the reviews and thought I had found the ultimate solution.WRONG!First, the pump is huge and the bellow is clumsy, it does not compress smoothly.  You really have to stomp on it to get full air flow.Next, the nozzles are not long enough, not tapered enough and do not stay in the air inlet for the ball.  So, you spend a bunch of time filling the ball, the nozzle falls out and you lose some of the precious air you just pumped in.Worst of all is the pump suffers from backflow when the air pressure inside the ball gets high, at the point when you are trying to get the ball rigid.  Each time you pump, you hear the air leaking out of the tube (red fitting at the base) and back out of the bellow intake.  I am going to try putting electrical tape around the tube connection to see if that helps, but my confidence is low.I only bought this to fill up stability balls while traveling, so I cannot speak to its ability to fill basketballs, inflatable mattresses, etc.  I saw a review by someone wanting to fill a kayak and they had the same results - could not finish the job.I had considered a small electric pump, but the reviews for those stated that they were ineffective in finishing the job as well.I will continue my search.  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this one.</div>

    <div class="answerText">I've never tried it on exercise balls, but I used it on an air mattress.  It's good for pumping air faster than a bicycle pump, but if you need more pressure, you might need to use a bicycle pump instead.  I'm not sure how much pressure this can handle, or how much pressure an exercise ball needs.</div>

Have the powered model to get the mattress full but that never gets it quite as full as we need.  This pump adds that extra air the other models don't have the power to supply.  Had our last one for over 10 years and one of the metal rings finally gave out and fell off.  Still used for 2 more years but decided to replace this year!</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I've been doing puzzles since my mom took me to daycare, this is the largest puzzle I've completed to date (though I want to get the 24000 piece puzzle someday). This puzzle was very fun. Unlike a lot of puzzles that are one huge image, this is several images that can be worked on separately until its all done. I really like that there isn't a lot of fields of one colour. The space part is a little like that, but there is enough variety to keep it from being absolutely mind numbing. The tiniest gripe I have is that the pieces of the two halves are identically shaped, which lead to a few go backs realizing I had a slightly wrong colour piece in a spot. This wasn't a huge issue, but I like to see a complete variety. I started the puzzle on Feb 1st and completed it March 17th, so it consumed a good amount of time. I read complaints of missing pieces, and I will say that I had no missing pieces with mine.Highly recommended for any puzzle enthusiast!</div>

    <div class="answerText">The dimensions of this puzzle are: 76" x 54" which is 6 feet 4 inches by 4 feet 8 inches or 193.04 cm by 137.16 cm. As for the question is it 4 times as large as a normal 1000 piece puzzle that is difficult to answer as 1000 piece puzzles vary in size by manufacturer. Ravensburger seems to go with a 27" x 20" size format for their 1000 piece puzzles, which would be 68.58 cm by 50.8 cm size. So using those dimensions 68.58 cm x 50.8 cm and multiplying by 4 it would be a puzzle bigger than this 9000 piece puzzle. So the puzzle piece sizes in this 9000 piece are smaller than a normal 1000 piece. All larger puzzles by Ravensburger ship with multiple bags, so in this case these are (2) 4500 piece bags and you can do the puzzle in 2 parts and then put those larger pieces together as a finishing touch. You could always elect to mix both bags together for the added challenge and put it together on one giant surface.

    <div class="reviewText">I have NOT even opened the seal but once I finish the Ravensburger 3000 piece ancient globe map puzzle this is my next conquest. This has to be one of the most beautifully designed puzzles ever. The concept of making a puzzle about the zodiac signs to me would not have been really anything really special in my mind, but once I saw this I knew someone spent a lot of time thinking about how to lay this out in a very beautiful and intriquing manner. The detail is amazing and has numerous break points in which you can attack this puzzle. The innermost circle is a design of the solar system, with a black ring around it. Then there are the 12 unique zodiac symbols which are seperated into individual areas and are all encircled with a double black ring around it. Then there is a silver ring with the month ranges defining when during the calendar year each zodiac symbol covers. Next are the 12 seperated mini paintings of what the zodiac signs represent which are very colorful and detailed. Next there is a silver 12 sided circle that is offset that is acting as the top of the zodiac pictures. Then in each compartment  is the name of each zodiac sign in big letters. Then there is the last ring which is another 12 sided circle that is flush to the top of the puzzle. Now we get into the astronomy aspect of the zodiac signs where they are all drawn out in the night sky with the zodiac symbol near them so people can identify them appropriately. Lastly there are 4 symbols in total each in a different corner that help separate out each quadrant. I completely agree this is worthy of getting framed and being put on your wall for all to see for it truly is a work of art. Kudos to Ravensburger for designing this and also to their attention to detail on the artwork. Additionally some people may say a puzzle is a puzzle there are no differences from one manufacturer to the next. That is by far a incorrect statement. Ravensburger pieces really are unique and you will not find yourself with 20 pieces that oddly enough all fit into the same space creating an additional layer of complexity for no reason. I highly recommend Ravensburger products and this puzzle very specifically. It would be cool if they brought back their out of print puzzle called &#34;Tarot&#34; that was 2000 pieces as that is another really interesting piece of artwork.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I was HIGHLY concerned with making this purchased, having read numerous negative reviews.  I'm considering this a starter set for my 8 year old son, who shocked us with his Christmas list when he asked for a chess set.  I wanted to by something nicer (wood) than a $5 plastic and cardboard set.  I also didn't want to invest some $200 chess table with marble pieces only to have him be disinterested in chess in a month.  This $30 to $40 price range seemed appropriate, but the negative reviews on virtually ever set on Amazon were disheartening.Needless to say I am glad I took the risk on this one.  I'm not getting a $100 chess set for $35 but for $35 this far exceeded my expectations.  The board is very nice, the pieces seem of decent quality and the wood checker pieces actually stack for &#34;kinging&#34;I think folks who have a problem with the quality of this product may want to consider what they paid for it...</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I read a ton of reviews, most of which indicated that the bubbles did not work, before making this purchase. I felt encouraged by the reviews that said the mower just needed a different bubble solution. We tried a 3 different types of solution and none of them worked. My husband was able to get a couple of small bubbles out if he ran really fast with it, but my 2 year old would not be able to make the mower work in this manner. That being said, my son loves playing with this mower despite the bubbles not working.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I got this for my son's second birthday, almost a year and a half ago, and he's still entertained by it.  The bubbles did work until the bottle ran out and we didn't bother refilling it, since I had read the reviews by others and figured I'd skip the irritation.  He doesn't care anyhow! This little mower gives a pleasant and muted "mowing" sound when pushed and it's very sturdy.  After over a year of using it, it's still in good condition, despite being left outside all the time in the rain, snow, and really hot summers.  Colors haven't faded either! I'm impressed with the quality of this toy, especially for $20.</div>

    </div>
    <div class="reviewText">Bought this for our 2yr old grandson for Christmas because he was obsessed with trying to push a real, heavy mower around (not on, of course). We snapped the toy together and wrapped it ready for use.  Our grandson pulled the paper off, and with a HUGE smile proceeded to mow the floors in the house for well over an hour while the rest of the family unwrapped gifts.  A neighbor had previously given him a mower that was yellow and played songs, but it was not realistic enough to be a substitute.  This Fisher-Price model is visually true and even has a motor sound that starts when the tires move.  We'll introduce the bubbles when it warms up outside.  A great toy for a toddler!</div>

    <div class="description">
      <p>Clue has been a fiendishly clever board game for almost 60 years, and this DVD edition adds a whole <span id="dots-B000B4SPX4">...</span><span id="more-B000B4SPX4" style="display:none">new level of enjoyment to the deductive fun. Experienced Clue-doers will recognize the floor plan layout of the game board, as well as the cards and character pieces. What they might not recognize this time is the crime: The game's central intrigue has been downgraded from murder to a more family-friendly larceny. It's up to players to figure out which of Mr. Boddy's guests is the thief, which item was stolen, as well as the time and location of the theft. The enclosed DVD serves as game master, with animated butler and inspector characters prompting you with questions and/or doling out clues. It may seem like a gimmick at first, but there are several smart ways in which the DVD makes set-up a snap and games both fair and interesting.Aside from the bells and whistles, this is Clue. The object of the game is to gather clues without giving away too much information to the other players. Once you feel you've adequately sussed out the case, you can test your theory in secrecy through the DVD menu and the special decoder lens. If you're correct, you'll get a satisfying detective show round-up of how all the clues work together to eliminate all of the other possibilities. If you're wrong, you're going to have to show some of your info to the other players. There are ten different mysteries built into the game plus a general game that is more like the traditional Clue board game. It comes with game cards, decoder magnifying glass, DVD disc, game board, four plastic locks, case file envelope, and 10 suspect pawns.--Porter B.

After 10 or 20 minutes the DVD will wake up and do something exciting. Then you continue playing like normal. Slowly, over the course of an hour, the DVD will enable more options that you can use.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">No review here really explains how to use this DVD system. As you can see, many reviewers (including this one) were confused by the operation of the DVD.It's important to note that the DVD does not drive the game or follow along with the game. The DVD does not track whose turn it is or where each player is on the board. When you first start the game the DVD will only light up two options: "use a secret passage" and "make an accusation." You won't be making accusations until near the end of the game, so the only options seems to be the secret passage and that's confusing all of us. The other options are all gray.I just spoke to HASBRO today and the lady mentioned that you may have to play 15 or 20 minutes before the DVD starts doing anything. You just play the board game like normal at first, you don't use the DVD at all after it instructs you how to setup the board and game play begins. After several turns you may use the DVD when you are in a room where you want to use a secret passage. The DVD may tell you that something unexpected happens while you are traversing the passage. Eventually after possibly 10s of minutes, the DVD may do something. The DVD works on a timer. The DVD senses how much time has passed and starts yielding the clues as time goes on. What will happen is that as the DVD just sits there on the options screen, seemingly doing nothing other than looping thru its music and watermark animation, it's actually counting time. It assumes that you are playing the Clue game just like normal. At some random time interval, the DVD will come to life and the inspector will say "I would like to see you right now." Then you can use the remote control to answer the inspector and he will play a clue for you. After that he may turn on one of the other options like "call the butler" and then you may start using that option. As the game progresses more of the options will become available.To answer some concerns that other reviewers have mentioned:It should be noted that a DVD is of limited intelligence. It's not a general purpose programming medium so it can't be as smart as a normal computer program. It was never intended to do anything as smart as play a game, so it's only clever programming that gets it to simulate the intelligence it needs. As such you shouldn't expect too much out of it.The 10 fixed cases in the Clue DVD game allow custom animation. For example, if Miss Scarlet stole the broach at midnight, a dramatic animated scene can be scripted such that Mr. Boddy tells of how Miss Scarlet tried on the broach and he knew that she was an incorrigible night owl. For this kind of content the fixed cases are a must. With a normal computer program it might be able to shuffle predetermined scenes or lines of dialog to match a random case, but the DVD is not that smart. So the fixed cases are a compromise of allowing nifty Clue scripts to be played at the expense of having a finite number of Clue cases on the DVD. The DVD also includes a random case but that's not going to feature the custom story line and animated snippets. It's going to be more generic.You could just play regular Clue with it, you don't have to use the DVD. Compared to Classic Clue it's a deluxe game with the cute dolls, 3D colorful game board, and the expanded possibilities. Compared to the standard Clue game this one is missing the weapons so that's too bad. If you don't like the expanded possibilities because it makes the game longer, just eliminate some cards at the start.</div>

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">12 17, 2010</div>
    </div>
    <div class="reviewText">I bought this set of ZOOB for my 5-year-old grandson because my 10-year-old grandson got this set a few years ago - he has played with it nearly every day since receiving it and still does.  We have never had a broken piece; the pieces all fit nicely into the storage case, which is very sturdy; and the instruction/idea booklets that come with it are creative and for the most part easy to follow.  My only complaint (pertaining to the set we've had for years) is that the purple latches on the storage box never stayed attached when the box is open and they are difficult even for me to unlatch from the closed position.  I haven't examined the new set to see if this feature has changed but the picture looks the same.  This is one of the best building toys I have ever seen.</div>

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">02 25, 2014</div>
    </div>
    <div class="reviewText">When I first  ordered these I was super skeptical, especially considering the fact that they're kind of pricey. I read pretty much every single review and decided on the 500 piece because I have 2 boys, ages 6 and 11. I couldn't be happier! They have had countless hours of fun building things from the instruction book and designing their own pieces. There's plenty of pieces so there's no arguing if they're wanting to build their own things, and they have been playing well together too! (Which with these two is a gift all alone!) Definitely a good cold day activity that keeps them off the computers and tablets, using their brains, and being creative! I also purchased the ZOOB RACER, which is also fantastic. All of the pieces are super sturdy, as well as the carrying case. Will definitely be adding onto our collection soon!!</div>

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">06 7, 2014</div>
    </div>
    <div class="reviewText">I tried out a previous ZOOB Traveler set in the past and completely fell in love with ZOOB. Not only because it awakened the creativity of my own daughters, but Also because I was able to use it in numerous ways with the students that I work with on a daily basis. With this larger set I am able to do so much more and create so many more things. Recently, I had a professional development workshop that I was facilitating and I brought this set with me. I ended up placing pieces of the ZOOB 500 on each of the tables and let everyone know that they could create whatever they wanted to with the pieces there. You should have seen how excited these adults were, it was like they were children again. ZOOB allows the inner-child to be awakened, and really the sky is the limit when it comes to what you can create and what ZOOB can allow you to do. I highly recommend this set and ZOOB in general to one and all, it is by far one of the best new toys I have come across!*I received this for review - all opinions are my own*</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I like the beads.  They have the additional benefit of making the tumbling even quieter.I've re-used my beads several times:  you just have to be sure to use them with the same grit each time.  The ones I use for the second step grit do get smaller, so I have to add more and replace them more often.  For the third and fourth (pre-polish and polish) steps, they show very little wear.Separating them from the rocks is a snap.  I use a kitchen strainer to rinse rocks and beads; dump the whole thing into a container and fill it with water; and then pour the beads back into the strainer as they float on the surface (unlike the rocks).  I rinse them some some more, air dry them in the strainer, and return them to the ziploc bag marked for that stage.  Easy peasy!</div>

    <div class="answerText">Yes.  The beads protect the stones during the tumbling process and can be reused.  Wash them thoroughly and use one set of beads for the coarse steps and another set for the polishing steps.  That way you don't have to worry about any residue on the beads scratching your stones during the polishing process.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">These act as a filler for our Lortone rock tumbler.  It helps prevent chipping of the rocks.  We don't reuse the beads so think of this as a disposable part of your rock tumbler.  Whenever its time to go to the next finer grit then we use new beads because you can't clean the grit out of the beads.  It might be possible to reuse these but then you have to separate them and keep track of the fineness of the grit you used along with each step in order to not scratch your rocks.  We fill the rock tumbler halfway with the beads, water and rocks.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Just finished making my first run in it, had a great time.  Produce some really nice looking rocks.No problems running it at all.  The rubber barrel makes it repetitively quiet (run it in a closet and barely hear any noise (bit like rain).My seven year old lost interest pretty quickly (though enjoys sorting through stones and picking some finish ones for jewelery.)But I'm loving it.Went to ebay and bought grits for a 12# tumbler for just over $20 delivered (he through in a couple of pounds of rock as well free), so I have grits for another 6 runs...Plenty of rocks at good prices at Ebay as well (group your purchases to save on shipping as its a killer when buying a couple of pounds of rocks).  My local beach has lots of quarts pebbles so no shortage of matterial for me.Great price great deal...would recommend it over the toy little plastic barreled ones (since it only costs about $10 more) .</div>

    <div class="reviewText">The item works well but I was expecting a vibratory tumbler from the picture they had. They have since changed the picture from when I ordered it. I was very disappointed to see that it was a rotary tumbler since it takes twice as long to polish. As for the product it works well. The rubber barrel does rub on the plastic pieces of the tumbler's axle causing wear and tear.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">It is a pretty good tumbler, but you have to watch the tumbler bushings and keep them lubricated or it squeals like crazy. I tumbled the 1 lb. of stones that came with it and turned out pretty nice. Just be sure not to over load the little unit and you should get good use out of it.</div>

    <div class="answerText">Really don't know if there was a warranty.  However, the tumbler barrel lid doesn't last too long.  Seems like the friction of the stones tumbling are able to drill a hole in the center of the lid (twice this happened to 2 different lids).  Must be a manufacturing defect.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Like all little boys my son went nuts over this large Buzz Light year. He still loved it after the leg got snapped clean off by him stepping on it. Granted he is a big hid and at the time weighed about 30lbs. Also the laser stopped working, don't know why.If your Buzz breaks at any point I recommend scratching the plastic on the break site (so the glue can get a better hold) and using extreme gorilla glue. make sure it's the kind made for plastic.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I bought these before my son's 3rd Birthday &#34;Safari&#34; Party.  There are 5 sets of 12 different animals (actually we received an extra Ostrich, which oddly is his favorite).  We used some as cupcake toppers (perfect since they come in sets of 12), and also used some for the &#34;Safari Hunt&#34;, and he kept several to play with.  They wash well in the dishwasher (put in with the silverware on door), and seem pretty durable and very detailed for being so small.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I did a quick-build of this kit at cybermodeler.com and found the model goes together quite well. You can see the results for yourself without filler or paint on the model just how well this model is engineered. The kit represents an early-block Super Hornet so you may need some aftermarket updates if you're building a late-block airframe. Have fun with this kit as there are many great aftermarket decal options available 'out there'.</div>

Minimal pieces, and a little soft on the wallet in the event that they lose interest.  If they show a liking towards modeling, perhaps purchase this as a second kit.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I have built two of these kits since I got back into my modeling frenzy about a year ago, and they are really well built.  For the price, you absolutely cannot find a more suitable substitute.  The parts fit generally well, and it looks the part once completed.  There are a few very minor details that keep this from being a five start kit in my book.  Starting with the flaps being molded in the up position.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing if you plan on building a static display of a plane in flight, but generally, most people like to build them with weight on wheels.  There are aftermarket kits out there to allow you to surgically remove the default flaps and add lowered flaps, but it seems like a lot of work, and holds this kit back from being a real all star.  The other feature that I'm not a big fan of is the way the intake ducts go together, and the depth of the engine turbine faces.  When modeled, they are way too close towards the inlet itself, which is highly inaccurate.  Again, to the novice who simply wants to try their hand at building a great airplane, then that's a very small oversight.  Some putty is required along the top of the nose and in front of the windscreen to fill in some pretty obvious seams, but they're easy to tackle, and don't require too much sanding or filling.  All in all, when it's done, it looks really great, and you don't have to shell out 70 bucks to make it happen.  At such a low price, this is a great choice for me to grab if a customer wants a lock and stock Super Hornet, and aren't too picky on the realism.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I admit I always have doubts when I order from Revell; however, I was pleasantly surprised with this kit.  It seems their new molds are pretty much on par, it's their 1970's molds they still use for some of their WW2 aircraft that perpetuates the perception that Revell makes junk kits.  The instructions for this kit are clear and easy to understand.  I did not expect this kit to have intakes with trunks which enables you to see the fan blades for the engine, nice touch.  All the pieces fit well and went together with little sanding or 'creative manipulation'.  The only drawbacks are very minor.  Revell has a habit of modeling their copyright information on horizontal stabilizers - nothing some careful sanding can't knock out.  The flaps cannot be re-positioned easily because there's a thick actuator that controls the surface on the underside of the wing.  You would need to cut through that and reshape it.  Not worth the effort in my opinion!  Like I said, minor stuff.  I recommend this kit!</div>

    <div class="reviewText">The product was fun to build. My son loved playing with it. All the major components fit together nicely. There were some very small components that required tweezers for fitting, but its a model. Overall the product was great and the instructions were good. The only drawback is that it did not come with enough missiles to fully load the plane. Would recommend this model for others.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I have built two of these kits since I got back into my modeling frenzy about a year ago, and they are really well built.  For the price, you absolutely cannot find a more suitable substitute.  The parts fit generally well, and it looks the part once completed.  There are a few very minor details that keep this from being a five start kit in my book.  Starting with the flaps being molded in the up position.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing if you plan on building a static display of a plane in flight, but generally, most people like to build them with weight on wheels.  There are aftermarket kits out there to allow you to surgically remove the default flaps and add lowered flaps, but it seems like a lot of work, and holds this kit back from being a real all star.  The other feature that I'm not a big fan of is the way the intake ducts go together, and the depth of the engine turbine faces.  When modeled, they are way too close towards the inlet itself, which is highly inaccurate.  Again, to the novice who simply wants to try their hand at building a great airplane, then that's a very small oversight.  Some putty is required along the top of the nose and in front of the windscreen to fill in some pretty obvious seams, but they're easy to tackle, and don't require too much sanding or filling.  All in all, when it's done, it looks really great, and you don't have to shell out 70 bucks to make it happen.  At such a low price, this is a great choice for me to grab if a customer wants a lock and stock Super Hornet, and aren't too picky on the realism.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I did a quick-build of this kit at cybermodeler.com and found the model goes together quite well. You can see the results for yourself without filler or paint on the model just how well this model is engineered. The kit represents an early-block Super Hornet so you may need some aftermarket updates if you're building a late-block airframe. Have fun with this kit as there are many great aftermarket decal options available 'out there'.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Purchased this because the regular game (ZOMBIES!!!) doesn't come with enough pieces if you're playing with more than 2 people.  It's nice to have extra zombies available to continue playing them instead of running out in regular play.  A little pricey, but worth it if you play the game a lot.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">These zombies were purchased for a school project wherein my son re-imagined a strategy game with a humans vs. zombies theme. These tiny models of zombies worked perfectly for the project. The tiny models are durable, flexible plastic. They are uniform...thus more zombie-like, in fact. The company selling shipped immediately for a small shipping fee, so this was an overall great buying experience!</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I got these to use as &#34;bad guys&#34; for when my sons are playing with their Army men. I thought they'd be around the same size as the little plastic army men, but they're much smaller. The description says that they're 2&#34; but I just measured them and they're exactly 1&#34;. Maybe they were using a different ruler? Regardless, zombies are still all the rage these days so my boys still like them, but they just use them for other things.</div>

    <div class="answerText">I've never played D & D but I've played some other games where figure sizes are comparable. My opinion is that if it's close to the size of whatever game you're playing, why not use them?  I think that goes for any RPG game if you want to use figures for a visual effect or simply to keep track of character numbers/hit points.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Purchased this because the regular game (ZOMBIES!!!) doesn't come with enough pieces if you're playing with more than 2 people.  It's nice to have extra zombies available to continue playing them instead of running out in regular play.  A little pricey, but worth it if you play the game a lot.</div>

And then there&#x92;s the shedding and smell factors of dog ownership, not to mention the risks to allergic family members. So what&#x92;s an animal lover to do? Get a virtual Golden Retriever, of course! This particular fellow from Vmigo is full of energy and will love playing catch, the Sniffing Game, Disc Duel, or going on adventures. He&#x92;ll do tricks for his master, and if you brush him and give him treats and take him out when he needs a potty break, he&#x92;ll reward you with hours of slavish love. This virtual pup appears on the tiny screen of the Vmigo handheld or, if docked with the TV docking system, on your TV screen. Earn Pet Points by being a good dog owner, and use them toward "buying" supplies necessary to keep your pooch healthy and happy, or even to buy a new dog! Two pop-up menus allow owners to interact with their Golden (feeding, playing, moving him around, etc.). If players have a friend with another Vmigo pet, both users can link together to share the fun. And the docking system allows players to turn the hound loose on the big screen in full color and with vastly enhanced activities in Doggy Town! Requires three "AAA" batteries (included) and four "C" batteries (not included).--Emilie Coulter</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B000ETRFRI')" id="toggleBtn-B000ETRFRI">Show more</button>

    <div class="answerText">I bought this for someone who liked the Nintendogs game for Nintendo DS.  This is NOT a good replacement for that.  The handheld device is cheap and small.  It is hard to see the screen clearly.  Hooking the hand held device to the console and then to your TV doesn't make things much better.  The graphics are terrible and one cannot tell what is going on clearly.  Plus the game is simple and gets boring very quickly.  The console runs on C batteries - and no power adapter - so that is a con as well.  I wouldn't recommend this handheld game and console.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">This product arrived quickly and was as described.  The game is fun because you have a portable hand held game where you interact with a dog.  You get to pick the type of dog, name it, and then interact with it.  You can take the dog for walks, feed it, giv it water, let it sleep, play tricks and other things.  It's nice because kids can learn some responsibilities - like remembering to care for the dog and take it for walks.  The hand held unit then connects to the game console so you can hook it up to a TV - which allows for a much easier view.  The console runs on C batteries.  I believe the hand held unit which is the game itself runs on AAA batteries.  The big downside is the screen is hard to see on the portable hand held unit - so hooking it up to the TV allows the game to be played much easier.  Overall it is not a bad product at all - especially given the price.</div>

    <div class="answerText">Yes.  The Fisher-Price items are great for any age from 1-4.  The older the child, the more creative they can be.  I've had children and grandchildren build whole "cities" with the Fisher-Price sets.  They have combined the farm sets to create larger cities adding the airplanes, emergency vehicles, and cars.  All the figures fit into other sets.  There is no limit to their imagination and creativity.  Hope this helps.  FYI, I have 5 children (all grown) and 10 grandchildren.  They have all loved the Fisher-Price sets.</div>

It's extremely durable and looks brand new even after he's carried it around and dropped it everywhere. The handle is also a great idea for little hands.My biggest suggestion is to look elsewhere for a better price! I bought this at Wal-mart for him for $[...]!!</div>

    <div class="answerText">No, they are not bendable.  The size is perfect for little hands, and they are always popular in my classroom.  I have not had much luck with bendable figures.  The common ones have wood for the head, hands, and feet.  The bendable part is similar to a heavy duty pipe cleaner.  Frankly, they're difficult for the children to manipulate.  Hope this helps.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I purchased these figurines for my 3-year old son when we were told he may have autism.  It is important for children to use their imagination and pretend play and my son only played with cars and trains until I got him this set.  He loves it, especially the fireman.  The only negative is that some figurines have a narrow base and don't stand up very well.  Other than that, excellent purchase!</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I use this bulletin board set for an after-school art expressions program.Children readily identify with the pictures. It helps normalize drawing and discussion of emotions. Sometimes the kids copy an image, and later personalize it. I think it's helpful for them to see examples, rather than lead in with a discussion about emotions.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I use this bulletin board set for an after-school art expressions program.Children readily identify with the pictures. It helps normalize drawing and discussion of emotions. Sometimes the kids copy an image, and later personalize it. I think it's helpful for them to see examples, rather than lead in with a discussion about emotions.</div>

    <div class="answerText">It's actually several rigid boards. You are able to arrange pieces in the middle and on two side pieces and then pick up those side pieces to place them atop the middle area before folding the wings in. It's really very cool.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Bought this for my puzzle-lover for Christmas, and she loves it! It's the nicest one for a reasonable price. It has two half-size pull-out sheets for laying pieces on. You can sort your pieces on these and begin the puzzle on the middle flat piece. When you need your table, you just set the half-sheets on top of the middle piece and fold over the sides. There's felt everywhere, so your puzzle is very stable. I really can't imagine how this product could better fit the need. Certainly beats the cookie sheets she had been using.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">This is really a nifty way to store a puzzle you're working on.  There are two boards the size of the sides open in the picture that are removable that you store pieces on.  This in addition to all the space around the puzzle itself in the center area.  I think it works great.  I wish I had confidence in storing the puzzle vertically but I think this is to much to expect without some things shifting around.</div>

      <div class="reviewTime">03 19, 2014</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I bought this for my daughter's second birthday. She is somewhat in to dolls. She keeps getting dolls as gifts, but really only plays with one doll. My 4.5 yr old son pushes my daughter around in it more than anything. She's tall but is low on the weight percentile for her age -weighing about 23 pounds. The stroller has really held up well considering she keeps crawling in to it.The only thing I will call out, is the baby seat lays down - so if your kid is crawling around in it, watch out for the seat suddenly falling nearly flat. The only other thing I've noticed about it, is the mesh basket on the bottom will not lay straight and always seems to be rubbing on a wheel no matter what I do. Regardless of that, the stroller is great quality. The rubber wheels grip our hardwood and carpet really well and it does not have a plastic feel to it. She has also taken her baby for a walk outside and has no problem steering the stroller or handling it. The curved and padded handles are very easy to use. She loves pushing her baby around and having her brother push her around in it. This was a great buy for us and I anticipate as she gets older she will be using it even more.</div>

Very sturdy stroller, and adorable.  Takes a beating better than the other strollers I've seen.  Saw the McClaren one after it was abused and read ratings as well.  This definitely fares better.

    <div class="reviewText">My 2 yr old daughter loves this toy. As far as toy strollers go it is built very well. However, the back rest of the stroller doesn't have any support and lets be honest, any and all small children are going to sit in it themselves. LOL. I had to tie a thick ribbon acrossed the back of it so she won't fall thru. Easy fix. All in all we both love it and the fact that it matches the stroller I have for her is an added bonus! I would buy it again hands down.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Bought this for my granddaughter's second birthday...and she absolutely fell in love with it.  Pushed it around like a pro the very first time behind the wheels...very cute.  Decision to buy was based on other reviews and they were correct.  The fact that there are double wheels all around and the front pivot completely is perfect.  Without this feature the erratic pushing by a two year old could not be accomplished.  Great product!</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Bought a little too early on.  Child was about 1 when she received this so she could barely see over the top.  But loves it nonetheless.  Very sturdy stroller, and adorable.  Takes a beating better than the other strollers I've seen.  Saw the McClaren one after it was abused and read ratings as well.  This definitely fares better.  This was really made for older kids though.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">My 2 yr old daughter loves this toy. As far as toy strollers go it is built very well. However, the back rest of the stroller doesn't have any support and lets be honest, any and all small children are going to sit in it themselves. LOL. I had to tie a thick ribbon acrossed the back of it so she won't fall thru. Easy fix. All in all we both love it and the fact that it matches the stroller I have for her is an added bonus! I would buy it again hands down.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">For a Chicco product and for what I paid, I expected a much better quality.  Upon assembly straight out of the box, the wheels would not stay on despite them "clicking into place" as instructions said.  It also seems much flimsier on the seat frame and a lower grade fabric that what I was expecting, ESPECIALLY after reading all the rave reviews.  Don't waste your money on this.  This is a hunk of trash and is only worth 1/3 of what it is selling for.  What good is it if the wheels wont stay on, let alone a major safety hazard!  Being returned and my sweet 2 year old will not be getting to open a stroller on her birthday now since this one is defective :(</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I bought this for my daughter's second birthday. She is somewhat in to dolls. She keeps getting dolls as gifts, but really only plays with one doll. My 4.5 yr old son pushes my daughter around in it more than anything. She's tall but is low on the weight percentile for her age -weighing about 23 pounds. The stroller has really held up well considering she keeps crawling in to it.The only thing I will call out, is the baby seat lays down - so if your kid is crawling around in it, watch out for the seat suddenly falling nearly flat. The only other thing I've noticed about it, is the mesh basket on the bottom will not lay straight and always seems to be rubbing on a wheel no matter what I do. Regardless of that, the stroller is great quality. The rubber wheels grip our hardwood and carpet really well and it does not have a plastic feel to it. She has also taken her baby for a walk outside and has no problem steering the stroller or handling it. The curved and padded handles are very easy to use. She loves pushing her baby around and having her brother push her around in it. This was a great buy for us and I anticipate as she gets older she will be using it even more.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">This stroller is just what I was wanting for my daughter.  She is five years old and quite tall for her age yet it still works very well for her.  THe handles of most strollers are way too low for her - this is perfect!  Very cute and easy to put together.  The buckle is easy to do up and it seems to be super easy for her to steer around the house.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Bought this for my granddaughter's second birthday...and she absolutely fell in love with it.  Pushed it around like a pro the very first time behind the wheels...very cute.  Decision to buy was based on other reviews and they were correct.  The fact that there are double wheels all around and the front pivot completely is perfect.  Without this feature the erratic pushing by a two year old could not be accomplished.  Great product!</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I bought this for my grandaughter s 5th birthday. She has had a few cheaper strollers in the past all of which fell apart in a short time.  This one is sturdy, wheels easily and easy to assemble.  She loves strapping her &#34;baby&#34; into it and keeping all of baby's necessities in the storage area underneath.  Highly recommended and worth the extra expense.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">It's very difficult to find appropriate push toys like strollers and such for my incredibly tall 2.5 year old daughter, but this stroller is perfect. She loves it and takes it when we walk the dog, pushes it around our house, takes it to grandma's- you name it. She likes putting stuff in the basket underneath, hanging bags from the handles, reclining that seats so her babies can sleep. It was easy to put together and seems to be holding up great to my daughter's rough play, though it's only been a couple of months. It cost more than her actual umbrella stroller, but it's worth it.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I have been a &#34;nut&#34; for Yahtzee for better than 40 years.  It is the perfect combination of luck and strategy.  It is also simple enough that almost anyone can be taught the game in a very short time (I bought this one for my granddaughter).  The term &#34;travel game&#34; is a little puzzling however.  To test its accuracy, I set it on a table last night, and since then, it hasn't traveled an inch.  Not so much as budged.</div>

    <div class="answerText">Nothing! In fact, I was disappointed in this edition since the company makes an actual travel version which we had at one time, but lost. In the actual travel version, the dice are captured in a hand held cylinder which allows them to tumble when rolled against the hand and then traps them one at a time by snapping the back of the compartment holding the die in place. It is very cool! I kept looking till I found the true travel version. I kept it to give as a gift, since it is a favorite game.</div>

Don't always have time to play it because the adventure of your trip i.e. new sights, etc. takes priority. Amazon is one of the few places that you can get the travel size, and at a reasonable price.

Other than that it was good.  I did cut a piece of felt and glue it in and it was better, but shouldn't have to do that.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Have the full size version. This is for use on our trips; mainly because of size and convenience. The game is the same, but more manageable for packing. Don't always have time to play it because the adventure of your trip i.e. new sights, etc. takes priority. Amazon is one of the few places that you can get the travel size, and at a reasonable price.

    <div class="reviewText">I have been a &#34;nut&#34; for Yahtzee for better than 40 years.  It is the perfect combination of luck and strategy.  It is also simple enough that almost anyone can be taught the game in a very short time (I bought this one for my granddaughter).  The term &#34;travel game&#34; is a little puzzling however.  To test its accuracy, I set it on a table last night, and since then, it hasn't traveled an inch.  Not so much as budged.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">This is perfect for travel or if you don't have a lot of space to store board games. It is hard to find this version of Yahtzee so buy it if you see it. Hasbro's website doesn't even show this version as current which I think is a shame. Well worth the money.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Bought this truck for my two year old son who loves construction vehicles.  It is great! We love Bruder as usual and have not found a brand that is as tough and durable and well made.  It is definitely worth the price over a less expensive brand.  It is a great size for little hands to hold, and it is able to fit on the back of the Bruder flatbead truck his grandparents got him for Christmas.  Bruder trucks are amazing.  The rubber tires hold up well, and the best part is they don't make noise! You can upgrade some of them by purchasing a lights and sounds module separately, but we never do that.  It is great to have a toy that isn't blinking and making obnoxious noises all the time.  Thanks, Bruder for a great product my son can't get enough of!</div>

    <div class="answerText">Yes, it could. It's not motorized but would be fun in a sandbox. The bucket loader lifts all the way up, just like the actual construction machines, and tilts easily to "dump". My 2 year old loves it and so does his 4 year old cousin. It was a great buy for us.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">We got this for our daughter (1.5) because we are expecting a baby boy soon. She loves carrying this around, and hopefully will help ease the transition for her when we have an actual baby boy.I did not give this five stars, because the diaper does not stay on very well. Maybe the velcro needs to be stronger, or the diaper bigger. Either way, our daughter just carries the doll around naked (the doll is naked, not our daughter) because the clothes don't stay on very well.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Such a sweet hug-gable squishy doll! Perfect for naps and snuggles. I got him for my grandson who is 2.5 thinking it would be a good way for him to start relating to the names of body parts i.e. feet, fingers, belly button etc.Kids will like the fact that they can remove and replace the dolls clothing and then show how they can get themselves dressed too. I also think it's good for little kids to feel they are nurturing someone so taking care of some of the dolls imagined needs helps build empathizing skills too. It would make a great gift, also, for someone who was going to be a big brother or sister soon.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Got this cute little doll for my 2yr old son to get him used to the idea of having a baby brother in few months. I love the doll but he does not seem to understand why suddenly a doll instead Legos or a truck :) I think he is simply too young to understand the concept of having a little brother, nothing to do with the doll itself. As I said, I love it - it is well made, soft and very cute. Has removable diaper and adorable belly-button. It looks durable and I'd was it in the washer if we ever needed to. Unfortunately I cannot vouch on the durability since we are not using it much but it looks like it could be somebody's 24/7 buddy and take it well.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">What an adorable doll!  My seven year old son likes dolls, and he fell in love with this one as soon as he saw it.  The doll is very light weight for the size (15"), and extremely cuddly.  There are no hard parts on this doll, which has a cute, slightly protruding nose, defined buttocks, outie belly button, and defined fingers and toes.  The doll does not have nipples nor genitalia, and there is only the slightest little tuft of hair on the top of the head.  Though the pajama top and nappy come off and reattach with Velcro, the hat and ID bracelet are attached to the doll.  My son and I both find the doll's smile to be welcoming and pleasant.I dislike that the product description is stereotypically sexist in saying that the doll is "(t)he perfect gift for a new big sister" as opposed to "a new big sibling" or some such.  Boys often grow up to be fathers, and learning how to nurture at a young age benefits ALL children, regardless of gender.The only other problem in my opinion is the price, which seems a bit high for what one is getting.  I think it would be more appropriately priced around $15-16, not the $21.54 as it is listed at the time of this review.Overall, however, it's a charming little doll with lots of snuggliness.  If your kid takes this to bed and rolls over onto it, s/he won't be likely to wake up because of doing so, as he's rather pillow-like.  Not a bad purchase if you don't mind the pricing.</div>

Overall quality and look, stitching was poor and the hair tuft is awful, clothes and diaper fit poorly. hat is sewn on. Hospital bracelet also sewn on. I was planning to return but the hassle wasn't worth it. The only completely ignored Christmas gift either of my children recived.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I purchased this doll for my son's first birthday in hopes to encourage his nurturing side, as he will soon be a big brother. He loves this doll, will carry it around, wrestle it, rock it, hug and kiss it.  He's not super into the changeable clothes yet, but Preemie size baby clothes do fit it. The hat does not come off, it is attached with a few stitches.My little Guy loves his baby, and I would recommended this, or it's counterparts as good first time babies. The fact that they are all soft is nice, and they little belly button is adorable.</div>

    <div class="answerText">I looked at them and there is no brand identification. While the depth of the trays is great, the fact is they do not turn very well. There is too much weight when you have 6 decks of cards. They would are better as just trays without the turntable. We took the bottom half of the turntable off but that leaves a plastic spike that make the tray tippy. So, we placed it on a dry wash cloth so it could be moved around the table without the screeching sound.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">The Revolving Playing Card Tray Holder for six decks is a great product.  I have never seen such a large card holder.  Only complaint is it is not as sturdy as I'm not sure if it is the older ones or just the shorter ones.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">These are impossible to find in stores around our area, so worth the price to order online, even with shipping. The smaller ones that often come in sets just don't allow for creative building. Our 4 and 2 year old grandchildren play with these almost every day. They are a little flexible, I imagine to keep them from cracking or snapping if dropped. The kids have tossed them around since Christmas and they have stood up to their wild play.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Love, Love, Love.  The kids are always looking for places to build and not everyone has the room or money for a big duplo table.  So the boards are perfect.  Also, if you have multiple kids, get muliple boards so they each have their own.  They fight over the duplo table at my house and don't like their space invaded by others.  The boards help with this as they each have their own.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">When the plates arrived my 2 year old son was anxious to build a Lego City!  They are thin and easily breakable for toddlers, so I picked up and sanded the edges of a sheet of plywood...then I spray glued the plates side by side to the plywood.  After a few hours, it was dry but not permanent.  This way they can be removed later and stuck onto a table as he gets older.  His Lego City platform now sits on our coffee table at his level and is easily relocated to his room or anywhere else when necessary.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">These are impossible to find in stores around our area, so worth the price to order online, even with shipping. The smaller ones that often come in sets just don't allow for creative building. Our 4 and 2 year old grandchildren play with these almost every day. They are a little flexible, I imagine to keep them from cracking or snapping if dropped. The kids have tossed them around since Christmas and they have stood up to their wild play.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Just got a can and tried it out and GOOD GOD it stinks. The smell can be best described as the end result of a Deviled Egg, Cabbage, Chilli, and Beer Binge. It smells like a Bathtub full of P*ss someone farted in. A two squirt Dutch Oven of this stuff could end a marriage. Plus the smell lingers for a while.I highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys getting laughs at others expense. This is the Real Deal.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">The smell is soooooo strong that it's almost like that couldn't possibly be a real fart, so it kinda gives you away. But I suppose if you're just trying to mess with someone then it's perfect but if you are trying to keep someone away from you by a nasty fart, it will definitely work but they might catch on. Super super strong rotten egg smell.</div>

As with the entire Melissa and Doug collection, this bedroom set is beautiful and well-made. It is very life-like and quite sturdy for small furniture. The only issue is that drawers do fall easily.My daughter loves this set! and we are happy too of the purchase.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I bought this to refill a beanbag chair that had lost its stature, and it was easy to use and now supports as the beanbag chair did originally. I think the styrofoam beads may be a bit louder than the original ones (the new beads are a little shinier than the old ones and rub against each other when one moves while sitting), but otherwise great!As was mentioned in other reviews, this is not enough to fill a full bean bag chair, but given that it says in the product description that this is only 2.5 cubic feet, I'm unsure how that was a surprise for so many people.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">The labels/packaging is really shoddy, so I would not recommend purchasing as a gift. But it works fine. The reel that comes with it is retro--old, but cool.It doesn't seem like it's really a Fisher Price toy...it seems like a knock-off. But I couldn't find one in a store, so I haven't compared it personally. The packaging makes it look really cheap, though.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">This was to be a Christmas present and I was disappointed in it's ability to clearly view the reel, any reel.  The scenes were grainy looking when they should have been sharply defined.  I think the cheap plastic lens they used was of such poor material.  They looked porous rather than smooth and transparent which would account for the grainy viewing.</div>

They would not even open the box until they got to the lake and the antenna was not in the box. Very disappointed child. When ask to return it time had expired. Can you at least send the antenna so the item will work?</div>

When I explained, they finally said they would return with me paying the shipping plus a 15% resocking fee. No thanks....  will think twice before ordering a present off here in the future!</div>

I sent an e-mail to the company trying to find out how to replace them (I was willing to pay for new) and heard absolutely NOTHING in return. I sent three e-mails with no response.

    <div class="reviewText">It ran fine until it turned over when it hit the edge of the pool and took on water inside the hull.  The circuit board inside the hull got wet even though it was sealed (very sloppily sealed, but sealed - I checked it).  It's actually too large (28&#34;) for a pool unless you have a large pool and taking it to a lake may mean chasing it with your own boat when it dies!  When it dies, it dies - wherever it is.  Must recharge 4 hours for 10 to 15 minutes of use.  It is fast I have to say!  The rechargeable battery has to come out of the hull, be recharged and then returned to the hull.and plugged back in.  That's fine, but all the wires are in the way of removing and installing.  Before my grandson used it, I had to re-route all the lines away from the battery compartment.  I knew my grandson would break wires unplugging and plugging it in and it wouldn't be his fault.  It looked like a proto-type design before you cleaned up the mistakes.  Silly really.  Why build problems into a product?  I packed the whole thing up and returned it from where is came for a refund.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I did a lot of research after I reading that sitting down for long times is bad for you.  So I did more research to find a solution.  That is how I came to a yoga ball.  As I write this I am sitting on my yoga ball. I did my viewing on youtube how to properly sit on a yoga ball.  I do a lot of computer work and had back issues.  Now I don't, but it took awhile because I could acclimate myself to the yoga ball.  It took around a month to feel comfortable.I told my Doctor about it and when I saw her next she was sitting on a yoga ball.  LOLThe reason why I purchased this ball was because of the thickness.  I initially purchased a smaller size and gave it to a friend who is much shorter.  I am 5'11", and I can also exercise with it.Best and cheapest chair I have ever found.  Yet sometimes I do sit in a chair for a short time.They say don't bounce.  I love to bounce, especially when I am working and listening to good music.  I bounce and move from side to side.This ball has changed my posture, and my life.</div>

It is the perfect size to sit at my cubicle desk.  It is very thick and pliable.  Very comfortable, and keeps me moving throughout the day, whereas I was just sitting for hours on end normally.  Came with everything needed to air it up and get it in use quickly.  The tape that came with it to measure whether it was full or not seems to be inaccurate, but if you have a tape measure of any sort, the guide it comes with tells you how many inches it will be all the way around once it is fully aired up.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Overall this has been a great purchase.  It's more difficult than I thought it would be to sit on at work, but mostly because it doesn't provide the same amount mobility as a chair with wheels.  I had a difficult time knowing how full to fill it with air.  Others complained about the pump, but I found it to be fine.It's a big hit in my office, though.  Co-workers have borrowed it when I'm out.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I ordered this to use it in lieu of a computer chair and I love it. I'm 5'7" so I got the largest ball and inflated it most of the way and its pretty comfortable. The first few days my back got a little tired (I was used to slouching in a reg computer chair before) but now it seems natural. I move a lot on the ball between calls and after a month I've noticed my abs are a little tighter. My only goal with this purchase was to amuse myself at work and it has done that and then some! Lol. Its fun! Give it a try!</div>

I sit on it instead of using a computer chair, and it not only holds my weight with no difficulty (I weigh a bit over 400lbs, and I'm not gentle with it anymore), it also is totally comfortable to sit on for hours and the right height for sitting at my desk. I also use it for some of my exercises in DDP Yoga, where it is a big help on the moves I have trouble doing.</div>

    <div class="answerText">It does not have suction.  It does pull air in (and came with some little foam beads to suck up) but it's not really effective even with those (and that's just going to be a headache you don't want to get started).  I git the impression reading about the vacuum and reviewing the manual that it used to have more legit suction (it's certainly laid out like a real vacuum) but that it was toned down over safety concerns.</div>

It is a item you can always take with ou especially the little one the I got for for granddaughter.The only thing I don't like is it is hard to break away from using it.Artist or not is is very relaxing if you just sit there there and doodle. and your not wasting any paper in the process.</div>

    <div class="answerText">This Mini Buddha Board is labeled as gift card because the board comes with 12 occasion stickers (such as happy birthday, ect.) that you could stick on the front of the board in order to give it as a gift. There is also a section inside the case, opposite of the buddha board itself, that has space to write out a permanent note. So, in short, the board can be given away as a personalized gift if you open the product and set it up before giving it away.</div>

    <div class="answerText">Yes they seem to be made of MDF and it is a fact that the paint chips off on the edges where they impact when repeatedly thrown or dropped, not too unrealistic a reality.  I think from a green recycling perspective I'de rather they we made of MDF than solid wood, it saves allot of trees this way, and these amazing puzzles are not very expensive.

These highly sea worthy fighting ships of around 20 meters (66') in length had a bow at both ends, enabling them to beach and/or launch in either direction. The shallow draught of only 1.5 meters (5') also gave the Vikings the option of sailing or rowing up inland waterways and rivers, allowing them to raid areas deep in the hinterland. With these fast (a speed of 20 knots) and very maneuverable fighting ships also known as "Dragon Boats", the Vikings ventured as far away as Iceland, Greenland and even North America, as excavations at settlements have proven.</p><button onclick="toggleDescription('B000N2F5G4')" id="toggleBtn-B000N2F5G4">Show more</button>

    <div class="answerText">Arthur Macon is correct.  However, paint the center gunmetal or whatever color you choose prior to emplacing decal.  I just took photos to post but not sure I can here.  Its tedious which is why I have a ship with no shields sitting on my Iraq artifacts.  I did not use Micro_Sol, but I will certainly purchase it to test its capabilities.  I just used very tiny bareli visible droplets of  crazy glue.  But I had to cut each shield a hole with a razor.   I have a few that look great but no I did not complete it and its been sitting there almost a year I think.  lol.  Good luck homes.</div>

      <div class="reviewTime">03 7, 2014</div>
    </div>
    <div class="reviewText">Bought for 28mm tabletop wargaming rather than a hobby or display piece. My chief concern was scale: was she going to be big enough to use with 28mm miniatures? She is, fitting approximately twenty &#34;standard human&#34; sized miniatures shoulder to shoulder. More if the miniatures are dwarfs or goblins, less if you have some big orks or a troll on board.Since the hull is fully rounded I formed a clay base in the shape and color of waves so as to fit with my tabletop coastal terrain rather than the kit supplied stands.The instructions are clear (no text but good illustrations) and the kit itself is not complex. Good molding, good quality plastic. My only contention is the decals for the shields: the center holes are not cut out, so they do not fit perfectly flat over the &#34;bump&#34; in the center of each plastic shield. There are time-consuming ways around this, but I opted to give the shields a simple paint and ink instead.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Those who have been making models for a long time probably remember Revell as a familiar name from their childhood.  There was hardly a subject that the model company did not take a crack at.  No matter the skill level, Revell's attention to details and nice prices allowed any modeler to pick up a kit they could be proud of and the Viking Ship is no exception.  Whether young or old, new or an old pro, this kit is a fun build.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">This ship has some really nice detailing. The wood grain looks great. I had this as a child and was really happy to find it again. My only problem is the big viking head decal for the sail. IN the past it was a black raven. That looked a lot less junior high mascot.</div>

      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">03 7, 2014</div>
    </div>
    <div class="reviewText">Bought for 28mm tabletop wargaming rather than a hobby or display piece. My chief concern was scale: was she going to be big enough to use with 28mm miniatures? She is, fitting approximately twenty &#34;standard human&#34; sized miniatures shoulder to shoulder. More if the miniatures are dwarfs or goblins, less if you have some big orks or a troll on board.Since the hull is fully rounded I formed a clay base in the shape and color of waves so as to fit with my tabletop coastal terrain rather than the kit supplied stands.The instructions are clear (no text but good illustrations) and the kit itself is not complex. Good molding, good quality plastic. My only contention is the decals for the shields: the center holes are not cut out, so they do not fit perfectly flat over the &#34;bump&#34; in the center of each plastic shield. There are time-consuming ways around this, but I opted to give the shields a simple paint and ink instead.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">We hosted the Honky Tonk Homicide for a group of 8 in their 60's and 70's.  Everyone really got into their characters with costumes, props, etc.  The &#34;bar&#34; set-up was fun.  The suggestion for bottles to be set around worked just great, and we used our deck as the site of dinner with newspapers as place mats and dead plants as centerpieces.  (Really tacky!)We had great fun trying to investigate the murder, but no one picked him/her out, so I guess the murderer was good at keeping us guessing.My only complaint was the script given to each character in our booklets was a little confusing, and since this was our first try at this, no one knew when to start and when to follow someone else.  Would have preferred more direction - like #1 speaker, for example.  That would have assisted our novice group.Overall well worth the price and a fun evening.  They also include a computer CD with another game, which we'll be trying.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">We just played this game over the weekend. I turned it into a large group game with the 8 main characters and some interaction from the "audience". The characters were perfect for their roles. It was so much fun. We created props from cardboard and I made finger foods for snacks. In between Chapters/Scenes, I allowed the guests to visit the "crime scene" for clues. The only thing I was worried about was the characters reading from their scripts in order so I numbered the paragraphs throughout the scripts to help them along. It was truly a fun time.

The suggestion for bottles to be set around worked just great, and we used our deck as the site of dinner with newspapers as place mats and dead plants as centerpieces.  (Really tacky!)We had great fun trying to investigate the murder, but no one picked him/her out, so I guess the murderer was good at keeping us guessing.My only complaint was the script given to each character in our booklets was a little confusing, and since this was our first try at this, no one knew when to start and when to follow someone else.  Would have preferred more direction - like #1 speaker, for example.  That would have assisted our novice group.Overall well worth the price and a fun evening.  They also include a computer CD with another game, which we'll be trying.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">As a new teacher, I needed everything and thought this was a great deal!  I have started using these stamps and I love them!  Completely affordable and a great variety.  My students make an effort to do all their work, so I make sure I make an  effort to acknowledge everything they turn in, even if it is not being used for a grade.  These stamps are a great way to show your appreciation for the students' efforts.  I also love how it comes in a case to easily store the stamps.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">These stamps are excellent for teachers. I bought these during Easter break and since I got back to school three weeks ago it is my  new grading staple. I would have given it four stars but u have to really press for the stamp to show the design properly. I love the case for the stamps and the fact their is a picture at the bottom of each stamp so you put the stamps back into its proper spot. These stamps are super savers because it is better than buying stickers.</div>

It is a cute toy and captured my girls attention for a while but after she saw my mom stick the fish and bait together with her hands instead of &#34;fishing&#34; for it, my daughter grabs the fish and does the same. Completely taking out the fun of the toy. Three stars not because im shifting blame and my dismay from my mom to the toy, but because there is no way to make the line longer. There is a knot that keeps it from winding the kine completely so there is very little reeling to do. You can maybe turn the rod three times and that's it.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">This set has a strong magnet, which makes catching the fish easier for little ones. I wish it had more than three fish and that the string was a bit longer. I ended up buying one at learning express that came with two wood fishing rods with a hook at the end that looks like the top of a hanger without being sharp. It also comes with about 7 fish. No magnets, so it is more challenging, but for a 3 year old the challenge of this toy is much more interesting than the Tolo one.</div>

The John Deere fishing rod 'talked&#34; but the reel never worked.  I bought a larger unnamed magnetic fishing rod and that reel never worked.  We took this one out of the box and it worked the first time - every time.  Though the fish are very big compared to the small magnet on their mouth, which makes them hard to &#34;catch.&#34;</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I bought two of these as gifts and wish I hadn't given them away now. I realized after opening this for my own 19 month old daughter, and the package says it is for 18+ - that there are a number of serious choking hazards present within this product, so it goes without saying that you should never leave your child unattended in the bath, but especially when using this toy!The small worm on the hook is a chokable if it comes unhooked from the line.The line itself is long enough that my 19 month old was able to wrap it around her neck all the way!Major choking and safety hazard for children and Amazon should consider removing immediately.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">We've had this toy for a year now, I think. The fishing line was shorter than I'd have liked, but I imagine that's for safety reasons. Safety's best, even at the expense of a more realistic play fishing experience. That said, I like this toy. It has bright colors. It's cute. The water drains out fairly completely after use (if you tip them the right way).  We've used them in a sensory bin full of dried beans, in the inflatable pool, and in the bath. My 2 and half year old daughter is just getting the hang of the rod and reel, but she's liked the toy since we got it. I think it's cute that they seem to kiss when they get close to each other.</div>

    <div class="answerText">No.  I thought this would be much cooler than it turned out to be.  It is the same one from the Baby Einstein videos, but would be better if the string reeled in and the fish floated.  Baby likes getting the magnet worm to hook the fish, and the magnet is strong enough that the fish stay on once they are "hooked".</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Typical good Lego quality. Lots of product for the money. I would probably rate the age range a little higher as it is difficult for younger ones to identify the various pieces among 405 pieces. If I were to do it again I would buy a larger set. It would be easier to keep such young ones focused on the project.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">In the good old days, you could buy buckets of Legos, and a child could use his/her imagination to build whatever.  Apparently now, kids have to be shown how to make a specific item.  Okay, I know the real reason is that those expensive little boxes make them more money.  This box is as close as you can come to the good old days.  Lots of the pieces a very small, there are too few wheels, and the box is ridiculously large for what comes in it.  But my grandson likes it, and it supplements his expensive little boxed sets.  (And when he comes to my house, he uses his dad's old bucket of Legos.)  Sigh.....</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Purchased this for a girl turning 10, who loves elephants.  This was my 2nd M & D &#34;large animal&#34; purchase (the 1st was the giraffe...HIGHLY rec'd!!)  These M & D animals are very well made, and worth every penny.  They do take up a bit of space, but are top quality.  The best &#34;stuffed animal&#34; you could buy.  Would also be great for a toddler, or adult (!) who fancies elephants.  Cool gift, at a great price. (And I am a tight-wad.)</div>

It is such a great size and looks as realistic as a stuffed animal can look! The durability is great- he climbs on it and pretends to ride on the elephant! Would definitely recommend!</div>

    <div class="reviewText">This castle had what our Children's Treatment Team was looking for: draw bridge, dungeon with trap door, no gender specific decorations, and durability. We like that it opens to allow better access when there are more players than one. Most of our figures fit but there are large spots (tops of towers, draw bridge, walkways) for the larger figures to be a part of the play. We purchased one to see if we liked it, and will be purchasing more to place in our other play rooms.</div>

    <div class="answerText">The doorways on this vary a LOT. What's most misleading is that it's not just the height you have to worry about, but the width as well. Depending on what kind of figurines you're using to play with, it's tricky to get them through the doors.Here are a few of the openings:Main entrance (largest): With the drawbridge, it has a clearance of about 4 1/2" tall in the center arch, and is 3 3/4" wide.'Throne Room' is 3 1/2" tall x 3 1/4" wide. (<<However, this is misleading, because the balcony being where it is reduces the opening to 2" tall.)Side towers (entrance from courtyard): 3 1/4 tall x 1 3/4 wide.the back tower is narrowest at 2 1/4" tall x only 1 1/4" wide.And the trap door runs about 1 1/2" x 2".We have a handful of figurines the kids use to play with. The Disney princesses with big ballskirts (roughly 3"x2", like Tiana and Belle) get stuck easily in the smaller openings or going through the trapdoor. The slimmer ones (like Mulan) fit through most openings. The Toob knights (roughly 2"x1", army man size) fit nearly everywhere. I hope that helps!

Depending on what kind of figurines you're using to play with, it's tricky to get them through the doors.Here are a few of the openings:Main entrance (largest): With the drawbridge, it has a clearance of about 4 1/2" tall in the center arch, and is 3 3/4" wide.'Throne Room' is 3 1/2" tall x 3 1/4" wide. (<<However, this is misleading, because the balcony being where it is reduces the opening to 2" tall.)Side towers (entrance from courtyard): 3 1/4 tall x 1 3/4 wide.the back tower is narrowest at 2 1/4" tall x only 1 1/4" wide.And the trap door runs about 1 1/2" x 2".We have a handful of figurines the kids use to play with. The Disney princesses with big ballskirts (roughly 3"x2", like Tiana and Belle) get stuck easily in the smaller openings or going through the trapdoor. The slimmer ones (like Mulan) fit through most openings. The Toob knights (roughly 2"x1", army man size) fit nearly everywhere. I hope that helps!

      <span class="summary">Fantastic 1st 'Doll House'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">01 18, 2013</div>
    </div>
    <div class="reviewText">My elder daughter (3 1/2), kept begging for a Barbie dollhouse for Christmas. I figured a doll house was in order - but I didn't want something overly pink, plastic-y, and related to a specific 'brand'. I wanted something she could use to play with whatever dolls she had on hand.I first spotted the pink, princess version of this on Amazon. I got the 'boy' version for 3 reasons. 1) It's more like historical castles (Neuschwanstein aside), which makes it more educational. 2) She'd never seen the pink version, so she wouldn't care, and 3) it has a jail. She LOVES stuffing her toys into various 'jails' (I don't try to analyze why).She has LOVED this toy. She and baby sis (age 1 1/2) play with it every day for hours. It has become home to many Disney princess figurines, Happy Meal toys, random small puppets. You name it - if it even remotely fits in the castle, it takes up residence.One CON is that some of the openings are SMALL. Toob knights (up to 2") fit well anywhere. The Disney princesses (which range in size from 2" to 4", depending upon what set you get - Buyer Beware, they're really not standard across their figurine sets) are larger and can get stuck. Belle, for example, with her huge skirt, can't go very far, while the slimmer Mulan hides out just about anywhere.This also means that the kids can get their toys stuck easily, then wanted mom to come free the toys. Be prepared for cries of 'the jail is full! get the toys out, please!'Overall, however, this is one of the BEST toys we've ever gotten. We also bought a set of M&D; wooden blocks, which have quickly become stables, out-buildings, bridges across the towers, stairs, you name it. If I only could buy 1 toy for the kids, it would be a toss-up between this and the M&D; wooden blocks. The best thing about this toy is that it's fun for mom and dad to play with, too. I spend a lot of 'floor time' with the girls when this castle is out.Of course, now, I'm totally eyeing that M&D; pirate ship so the princesses can go on more adventures. ;)</div>

    <div class="reviewText">very nice castle! i am always leery of purchasing things online, but i know that &#34;melissa and doug&#34; usually have nice, sturdy wood products. I bought this for my son, and he loves it!! it was delivered on time, and was much larger than i expected. we like the working draw bridge, the &#34;jail&#34; cell with moveable gate/door, and trap door that drops into the jail cell. you can't see that in any of the pictures, but it's there and a really nice surpise. my only reason for not rating it 5 stars, is that the trap door is slightly un-aligned, and doesn't close properly without some jiggling. it's not a major issue though, and i see no reason to return it. overall, i highly recommend!</div>

    <div class="reviewText">My three-year-old son fell in love with his cousin's dollhouse, so we thought this would be a good boy version. We planned on buying some furniture to go with it, but none of the chambers are large enough to hold anything like that. You can put the little knights/dolls in there, but there isn't room for anything else. I felt like it looked much bigger in the picture.It's very nice and well put together, but it doesn't get played with. He does want to sleep with it in his bed, but that the extent of the attention this toy gets. Other kids would probably love it, but I wished I would have tried harder to convince my husband to let me get him a real dollhouse instead.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">This castle had what our Children's Treatment Team was looking for: draw bridge, dungeon with trap door, no gender specific decorations, and durability. We like that it opens to allow better access when there are more players than one. Most of our figures fit but there are large spots (tops of towers, draw bridge, walkways) for the larger figures to be a part of the play. We purchased one to see if we liked it, and will be purchasing more to place in our other play rooms.</div>

We help our boys if they want to pick it up to move it as it is a little hard for them to carry it by themselves (and it might be hard on the hinges if not carried properly).  It's a great castle and neutral enough that any characters can be used with it (Star Wars guys, lego men, knights, etc.).  Our boys love it and play with it quite often.</div>

      <span class="summary">Fantastic 1st 'Doll House'</span>
      </div>
      <div class="reviewTime">01 18, 2013</div>
    </div>
    <div class="reviewText">My elder daughter (3 1/2), kept begging for a Barbie dollhouse for Christmas. I figured a doll house was in order - but I didn't want something overly pink, plastic-y, and related to a specific 'brand'. I wanted something she could use to play with whatever dolls she had on hand.I first spotted the pink, princess version of this on Amazon. I got the 'boy' version for 3 reasons. 1) It's more like historical castles (Neuschwanstein aside), which makes it more educational. 2) She'd never seen the pink version, so she wouldn't care, and 3) it has a jail. She LOVES stuffing her toys into various 'jails' (I don't try to analyze why).She has LOVED this toy. She and baby sis (age 1 1/2) play with it every day for hours. It has become home to many Disney princess figurines, Happy Meal toys, random small puppets. You name it - if it even remotely fits in the castle, it takes up residence.One CON is that some of the openings are SMALL. Toob knights (up to 2") fit well anywhere. The Disney princesses (which range in size from 2" to 4", depending upon what set you get - Buyer Beware, they're really not standard across their figurine sets) are larger and can get stuck. Belle, for example, with her huge skirt, can't go very far, while the slimmer Mulan hides out just about anywhere.This also means that the kids can get their toys stuck easily, then wanted mom to come free the toys. Be prepared for cries of 'the jail is full! get the toys out, please!'Overall, however, this is one of the BEST toys we've ever gotten. We also bought a set of M&D; wooden blocks, which have quickly become stables, out-buildings, bridges across the towers, stairs, you name it. If I only could buy 1 toy for the kids, it would be a toss-up between this and the M&D; wooden blocks. The best thing about this toy is that it's fun for mom and dad to play with, too. I spend a lot of 'floor time' with the girls when this castle is out.Of course, now, I'm totally eyeing that M&D; pirate ship so the princesses can go on more adventures. ;)</div>

    <div class="reviewText">My three-year-old son fell in love with his cousin's dollhouse, so we thought this would be a good boy version. We planned on buying some furniture to go with it, but none of the chambers are large enough to hold anything like that. You can put the little knights/dolls in there, but there isn't room for anything else. I felt like it looked much bigger in the picture.It's very nice and well put together, but it doesn't get played with. He does want to sleep with it in his bed, but that the extent of the attention this toy gets. Other kids would probably love it, but I wished I would have tried harder to convince my husband to let me get him a real dollhouse instead.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">My brothers and I recently purchased four packs.  We figured, given the high probability of us getting at least one holo/rare card [worth > $5], and the $0.25-$1.50 we could get for the less rare cards, that with 11 cards per pack [of which at least 2 or 3 will be worthless energy/common training cards] we had fair odds of getting around 32-36 cards worth an average of ~$0.75 [$24-$27], and 1-2 cards worth $5-$35 each.So, based on those expectations, we calculated that for the $52.33 we spent on four packs, the absolute worst we could do is have $29 worth of cards.  A $24 gamble was acceptable to us, so we purchased the cards.  In the end, once all opened and researched, the cumulative value of the cards we received was around $25--we got one holo card [Ninetails].Further, my brothers and I were watching Pokemon right before we ordered the cards.  Therefore, upon reflection, this purchase was probably the result of acute-impulsive-Christmas-time-Pokemon-nostalgia, for which we provided ourselves the excuse of potentially turning a profit so that we could convince ourselves that spending $50 on four packs of Pokemon cards was the right thing to do.In conclusion, if you are looking to add to your collection, these cards are delivered in mint condition and truly bring back that childhood excitement of opening the pack [except it wasn't mom's money this time].  But, if you are like my brothers and I, and you need to give yourself some false reassurance that this is going to be some kind of investment, then you may have acute-impulsive-Christmas-time-Pokemon-nostalgia and you probably ought to "think on it" a bit longer.</div>

I had to repair the transmitter because the slider that controls the speed was scaring on the circuit board, because the installation was scaring and not gliding on the metal part that goes across the circuit. I might have got a lemon. About what I would expect for the money spent.</div>

I would think fine sand, or you could use some model railroad gravel or something like that.  I suppose you could really mix concrete in it if you wanted to.  I am very impressed with the Bruder toys.  I think they are great and would like to collect them for myself.</div>

    <div class="answerText">I have not let my kids put anything inside of it yet (other than toys they have thrown in there and we had to shake them out). We've had this truck for 3 years and my boys still love it, very durable. I am thinking since we've had it for so long that this spring I will let it be a sand box toy. But I think it would take a water hose to get all the sand out of the cement barrel. At that point may just stay a sand box toy.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">We purchased this truck a few years ago for Christmas.  This truck was a big hit with our son.  He still play with the truck often.  This truck is well made but I will caution that the plastic pieces such as the door mirrors will break off if played with too rough.  Our son is 3 and he has broken some of the plastic pieces (most of the truck is metal and durable).  Overall the truck is was an awesome purchase.  Highly reccommend!</div>

    <div class="reviewText">I order liquid ass the last week and it arrived on Friday. I was surprised that the bottle was literally filled up to maximum capacity. I decided to try it out in the hall way of my college dorm. One spray at the end of the hall and one at the beginning left the whole hallway smelling like a 400 lbs mans ass after he just worked out and wrestled four pigs while a cow took a dump on his chest and while a dog throw up and ate it twice. Basically this is legit ASS. This is hands down the best prank you can do it's soooo stealthy and I am ordering two more as we speak. So quit reading and BUY it right now it's too good to pass up. Trust me I'm a college student. Roman Noodles 4 Life!!!</div>

I am an ex-smoker who's sense of smell never really returned to normal, after 1 whiff of this bottle I almost collapsed from how strong the rotten a** smell was. I can only imagine how this would affect a virgin nose.</div>

It should last a few hours and a lot longer in small spaces. Some people can't ever get the smell out of cars</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Great for getting back at loud, inconsiderate neighbors and rude people. Just don't get ANY on you. Avoid the mist sprayer because the wind can give you back spray. Buy the squirt one. I keep a bottle in my car inside a plastic bag with latex gloves. When someone tailgates me or cuts me off I calmly smile and wait until they are parked and stealthly squirt it into the air vent of their car/truck/suv. Great revenge tool. Smell is vomit inducing!</div>

    <div class="answerText">Probably will last a few hours as most but don't count on it. It's very intense for the first few hours if there is no air movement in the space in which you deploy Liquid Ass. It may not last through the night but when it's deployed it will usually create a series of comical events that involves people bringing big fans and air purifiers into the space where Liquid Ass was unleashed, and often, the janitorial staff is called into action as well.</div>

I don't know how they did it, but it has all the WORST smells I've ever smelled in my life all rolled into one bottle! Imagine the worst bad breath you've ever smelled, now go back to a time when you were at some outdoor event and it is SCATHING hot for days - and you have to go to an outhouse that's been sitting, baking, for DAYS in that heat (yeah, that's the smell) now, toss in a pro boxer's locker room after a long days'  practice, and a couple of sewer rats that climbed under your house and died - about 2 weeks ago. ALL that combined would be BETTER than what is in this bottle! Honestly, I thought I was going to vomit at a slight whiff...WARNING: it does NOT just smell like 'ass'!!</div>

This spray does not smell like the typical rotten egg fart bombs or sprays.  It really does smell like an fat guy's sweaty, hairy bunghole that hasn't been showered for days.  This spray is so rank oh em gee.  I had no choice but to order it and play pranks on people.  Soon as I got it, my daughter and I sprayed it in a small grocery store aisle and recorded people's reactions to it LMAO.  This is a must-have and I will be ordering the 3 pack once I run out of this one.</div>

Apparently the rule of no spraying in the house was completely disregarded . He tormented his sisters with this god awful spelling stuff one of them got it to the face that took all day to get off! soon I got home and my house smelled of butt pretty bad (product works!)He took it to school and some had spilled in his back pack LMAO served him right !This product doesn't smell like a fart it smells like a butt that hasn't been cleaned in forever or poop.

    <div class="reviewText">So I needed to get back at my douchebag ex-boyfriend and saw this product. I poured it outside his door (he lives in a dorm) and days later I see he is still complaining of the stink!I sniffed it just by taking off the clear cap, not spraying it or anything and it REEKS. If you want to play a prank, I would suggest this product because it is great! It smells like a dying carcass that has been s*** on and left in the sun to rot. Caused my friend to gag violently. If you have a weak stomach beware!</div>

    <div class="reviewText">Sooo funny yet sooo nasty. I read the reviews and some people said that it's not that bad while others were opposite. Well the ones who thought it wasn't bad need to get their noses checked. This stuff smells worse then a rotten porta potty on a hot summer day. I sprayed it on the back of a guys shirt at work and the other five guys in the room started running away and gagging. Made everyone's stomach turn. Well done</div>

It doesn't get on you unless you spray it on your self. But it does make your figure smell so that's the only bad thing about it.</div>

    <div class="answerText">I imagine if you sprayed it directly onto something, the smell would be pretty concentrated on that item.  (Say a reef on a doorway - as soon as someone opened the door they would smell it.)  But I also imagine the smell would dissipitate quicker as well.       In short: yes it will still stink like a fart; but just like a fart, the bad smell will go away quicker in an open area.   Hope this was helpful.</div>

    <div class="reviewText">As intended, I purchased this as a gag gift to use amongst family and friends.  So far only my son in law has used it in his sister's room.  4 squirts into the air was enough to make her (18 y/o) cry and sleep in the living room that night.  Perfect to squirt in someone's car or office if they get on the wrong side of your playful mood too!!  Enjoy!!</div>

Better if used in an enclosed space. Also I think in very hot weather it will reek more. Also spray on cloth and hide away, as smell stays on cloth longer.</div>
